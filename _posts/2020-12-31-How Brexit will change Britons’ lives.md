Britons will have plenty of time to consider them as they finger their new dark-blue passports in the non-<small>EU</small> queues at European airports.</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p >Britons who settled on the continent before Brexit will have the rights of citizenship preserved under the Brexit withdrawal agreement. For everyone else, they will drop away as Big Ben strikes 11pm on December 31st. How Britons are treated thereafter will depend on the rules agreed in Mr Johnson’s new deal, the long-standing provisions of European law which apply to all “third-country nationals” from Americans to Zimbabweans, and the migration laws of individual <small>EU</small> states, which change with the political weather. Those holidaying on the continent for a fortnight a year may notice a little more hassle. Those who wish to go for longer—to study, or spend the summer in a second home—will find their rights and options curtailed dramatically.</p><p ><small>EU</small> citizens face almost no restrictions on moving to another state for work or leisure, and can cross borders more or less as they please. After Brexit, Britons will be limited to up to 90 days <strong>travel</strong> at a time without a visa within a six-month period. Border guards may demand proof of their plans, a return ticket, and that they have enough money for their stay. (Eurostar has urged all travellers to the continent after Brexit to arrive earlier than they used to.) Britons will lose the right to use automatic passport gates, and will receive rubber stamps in their passports.</p><p >Doing business will be much trickier: no longer will Britain be able to treat the <small>EU</small> as its home market. Business travellers will be able to visit for up to 90 days for meet-and-greet activities, such as attending sales meetings, trade fairs or conferences. But generally speaking, delivering a service—such as auditing accounts, playing in a concert or working as a chef—will require a <strong>work visa</strong>, and in many regulated sectors getting registered as a local professional too. Visa policy is largely a matter for national governments, which have their own criteria of skills, language requirements and fees that vary depending on the needs of the labour market. British students, no longer entitled to equal treatment, are likely to pay much higher fees for places at European universities.</p><p >Motorists will need to carry a green card, showing their <strong>insurance</strong> is valid. <small>EU</small> laws that prohibit customers from being hit with <strong>roaming charges</strong> when they use their mobile telephones abroad will drop away. Whether fees return depends on the deals that operators strike with their European counterparts; big operators, such as Vodafone, will have more clout than smaller ones. Britain will drop out of the <small>EU</small>’s <strong>pet-passport</strong> regime, which documents animals’ vaccinations and allows holidaymakers to take dogs and cats abroad; owners will instead need to obtain an animal health certificate from their vet each time they travel. Not all is lost, however. Under Mr Johnson’s plan, Britain hopes to retain a variant of the European Health Insurance Card, which grants holidaymakers <strong>emergency health care</strong> when on the continent.</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p ><strong>Retiring</strong> to a place in the sun will be a trickier affair, particularly for those on tight budgets. Each country has its own rules for foreign pensioners who want to stay. They typically need a minimum income and medical insurance. British owners of <strong>property </strong>abroad will be more vulnerable to tax raids too: in 2015, the European Court of Justice struck down a French tax on properties owned by other European nationals as incompatible with European Union law. Such protection against official whim is the difference between being a guest in a foreign land, and being someone who can declare: “Civis Europaeus sum.” <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p><p data-test-id="Footnote" >This article appeared in the Britain section of the print edition under the headline &quot;No longer in Rome&quot;</p>
