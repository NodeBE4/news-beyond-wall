The gleaming court of the Astana International Financial Centre, an investment zone opened in 2019, is led by a British chief executive, and served by nine British judges, who wear gold-and-black gowns trimmed with blue of the republic’s flag. Their chief justice, Lord Mance, was the deputy president of the Supreme Court. They apply law closely modelled on that of England and Wales, and a streamlined version of London’s procedural rules. Kazakhstan’s judiciary is weak, but these judges’ independence is guaranteed by the constitution. The court’s electronic system for filing bundles is as whizzy as any in the world. “They want this to be seen as rooted in all the qualities of London, effectively transplanted there,” says Andrew Spink <small>QC</small>, one of the judges.</p><p >English commercial law, like football, has been exported around the world. The game has been honed, and star players signed. Globalisation is both bringing more business to London, and creating new courts such as that in Nur-Sultan. That means jobs for British lawyers, and new competition for London.</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p >Britain has the second-largest legal market in the world after America, at £36.8bn ($51bn) by fee revenue, encompassing top City firms to high-street solicitors. Commercial litigation—the business of representing companies who’ve fallen out in court—is possibly the most prestigious bit, attracting the biggest brains and often the fattest fees. Its home, the Rolls Building a mile west of the skyscrapers of Leadenhall Street, is a complex of 31 court rooms (some super-sized, others with translation booths) which before covid-19 moved cases online had the throng and aesthetic of a municipal airport. It is thriving. The number of commercial cases in London has more than doubled since 2015, to 292 in the year to April, according to an analysis published on April 22nd by Portland Communications, a consultancy. The number of barristers serving foreign clients has doubled in a decade too.</p><p >Commercial courts underpin globalisation, assuring investors their rights will be protected when they venture abroad. They are also functions of it, for parties are free to choose where to go should things go wrong. For traders in medieval Europe, that was Bruges and Antwerp. Today, it’s often London. Take a Wednesday last month, when softly-spoken English barristers represented the Maltese owners of a ship damaged in Bangladesh, and those of the Panamanian vessel said to be to blame; the Danish tax authority, and the trader in Dubai it accuses of fraud; the Bank of St Petersburg, in a dispute with a Russian port boss; and a Cypriot property developer accused of swindling British pensioners.</p><p >London is attractive, for English judges don’t take bribes, are seen as not favouring home litigants over foreigners and don’t generally get leant upon by politicians. They are often specialists, which means judgments tend to dig more deeply than those elsewhere, says Derek Sweeting <small>QC</small>, chair of the Bar Council, the barristers’ professional body, and the common law can “adapt and develop embryonically” to new kinds of business dispute. Formats have been tweaked to speed up big cases.</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p >But that dominance is under pressure, from Brexit and tougher competition. The clientele in London is growing, but also becoming more domestic: Brits accounted for more than half of litigants last year, for the first time since Portland’s survey began, while those from Europe and the rest of the world have fallen as a share, to 12% and 35% respectively (see chart). “Business decisions are being made, and contracts are being written, that don’t as a muscle reflex include London as the default legal battleground,” says Philip Hall, a partner.</p><div ><figure><div itemscope="" itemProp="image" itemType="https://schema.org/ImageObject" data-slim="1"><meta itemProp="url" content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/662/90/sites/default/files/20210424_BRC581.png"/><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/662/90/sites/default/files/20210424_BRC581.png"  sizes="300px" alt=""/></div></figure><p >British lawyers have lost the automatic right to practice in Europe, and migration will become harder. <small>EU</small> rules which govern where cases are heard and ensure judgments are recognised and enforced throughout the bloc have dropped away. Britain hoped to join the Lugano Convention, a treaty that would deliver a similar effect. The European Commission is opposed, arguing it is part of the plumbing of the single market that Britain has left. Brits detect an appetite to strip the branches.</p><p >The result will be fragmentation, as judgments become more costly to enforce. Lawyers expect some litigation will shift to Europe. (This year’s bulge in cases may be due to a dash to meet the Brexit cut-off, some barristers think. Cases brought by covid-19 may be a factor, too.) Since the Brexit vote, English-speaking commercial courts have opened in Frankfurt, Hamburg, Paris and Amsterdam, and some academics want a single European court to rival London. It would be “ridiculous” if English judgments went unenforced, says Duco Oranje, a judge of the Netherlands Commercial Court. “We are not aiming at getting cases out of the teeth of the London commercial court, but strange things are happening,” he says. Mr Sweeting says Britain’s reputation for the rule of law, on which it trades, risks being tarnished by the government’s fights with lawyers and threat to break the Brexit treaty.</p><p >Competition is growing elsewhere, with new courts emerging in the United Arab Emirates, China and Singapore since 2004. (Lord Mance also serves in Singapore, while Lord Thomas, the former Lord Chief Justice, is president of Qatar’s commercial court.) Such courts generate new litigation, by fostering foreign investment, reckons Mr Spink (who is also a head of Outer Temple Chambers, a London set with outposts in Dubai and Abu Dhabi). But they can also draw work from their regions that would otherwise go to London, and nibble at its lead.</p><p >The judiciary’s answer is to prepare for the next wave of globalisation. Sir Geoffrey Vos, the Master of the Rolls, occupies a post dating to 1286, but talks like a Silicon Valley evangelist. Video hearings pioneered during the pandemic should be kept, he argues, for they make London more accessible to far-flung claimants. He has drawn up guidance on how judges should apply English law to crypto-assets, such as bitcoin, and to self-executing “smart” contracts. How judges weigh liability for decisions made by <small>AI</small> systems is another thorny question, and if London answers it clearly, he argues, the litigants will come. Brexit will not cause London’s legal work to dry up any more than it will the rest of the City’s, nor will competition. The question is whether London can ride new tides. <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p></div><p data-test-id="Footnote" >This article appeared in the Britain section of the print edition under the headline &quot;Ruling the world&quot;</p>
