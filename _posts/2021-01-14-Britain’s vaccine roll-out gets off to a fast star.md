In second and third place, some way behind, sit the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain, which are relying on a jab without published data from late-stage trials (see <a href="https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2021/01/13/bahrain-and-the-uae-are-relying-on-a-chinese-made-vaccine">article</a>). Next is Britain, the speediest big country.</p><p >British medics were quick off the mark with early approvals for the Pfizer-Bio<small>NT</small>ech and AstraZeneca-Oxford University vaccines, and the roll-out has recently sped up. On January 6th, 1.3m doses had been delivered. A week later, 3.1m had, a number equivalent to 4.5 doses per 100 people. Denmark, Britain’s nearest rival in Europe, has done 2.</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p >Though fast, the pace still needs to accelerate further to meet the government’s target of offering everyone in a big group—which includes people over the age of 70 and front-line health- and social-care workers—a jab by the middle of February. To meet it, around 2.5m doses will have to go out each week. Ministers promise they will.</p><div ><figure><div itemscope="" itemProp="image" itemType="https://schema.org/ImageObject" data-slim="1"><meta itemProp="url" content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/853/90/sites/default/files/images/print-edition/20210116_BRM969.png"/><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/853/90/sites/default/files/images/print-edition/20210116_BRM969.png"  sizes="300px" alt=""/></div></figure><p >The roll-out is not without flaws. The government has provided little information on, for instance, who exactly has received jabs, although more is promised soon. Care-home vaccinations seem to be getting done more slowly than in other countries that got off to a quick start. And observers have raised concerns about the lack of ventilation in mass-vaccination centres, in which elderly and vulnerable people congregate.</p><p >These are serious problems. They are also ones most of Europe would love to have—which is not a position Britain has been in for most of the pandemic.</p><p ><em>Editor’s note: Some of our covid-19 coverage is free for readers of </em>The Economist Today<em>, our daily <a href="https://www.economist.comhttps://my.economist.com/user#newsletter">newsletter</a>.
