Then, in 1992, he released “Pandora’s Box”, a mesmerising documentary series about technocratic rationalism. Blending rare archive footage, electronic music and grand arguments, “Pandora’s Box” marked the start of a unique approach that Mr Curtis has been developing ever since. Now aged 65, he has earned the status of “cult film-maker”. </p><p >In a new BBC series, “Can’t Get You Out Of My Head”, Mr Curtis has set himself his most ambitious task yet: to tell the “emotional history of the modern world”. He is a veteran of wide-ranging projects with high-concept themes. His previous film, “Hypernormalisation” (2016), applied the ideas of Alexei Yurchak, a Russian anthropologist, to modern politics; his previous work for the BBC includes “The Century of the Self” (2002), on the influence of Sigmund Freud, and “The Power of Nightmares” (2004), about the political consequences of terrorism. </p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p >In the six roughly hour-long episodes of “Can’t Get You Out Of My Head”, Mr Curtis presents viewers less with a history than an odyssey, roaming from the origins of computer science in the 19th century to the Yugoslav civil wars of the 1990s to the presidency of Donald Trump, and touching on many events in between. The episodes are anchored by some recurring figures: Michael X, a Trinidadian civil-rights activist and convicted murderer; Eduard Limonov, a Russian writer; Jiang Qing (pictured), Mao Zedong’s wife; Kerry Thornley, an American countercultural writer; and Afeni Shakur, a Black Panther and mother of Tupac, a rapper. </p><p >Though apparently unconnected—none of them ever met—the lives of these five characters represent the thrust of Mr Curtis’s loosely drawn argument: that a combination of individualism and the internet have stunted modern politics. In their different ways, argues Mr Curtis, these figures led the charge to what, he claims, is the current emotional state of humanity: a feeling of being trapped and without control while chaotic events swirl around. This may chime with viewers during the pandemic, albeit coincidentally (work on the series began before covid-19 struck).</p><p >Some of Mr Curtis’s points—about the negative impact of prescription drugs, and how conspiracy theories poison the minds of their believers—are well made. A rumination on the emotional impact of John F. Kennedy’s assassination, set to the Sex Pistols’ “Who Killed Bambi?”, is inspired. There is much to admire in Mr Curtis’s film-making technique, too, as he has once again sorted through the archives to find striking footage that would otherwise be sitting in library databases. One episode is punctuated by a film showing the rocket of Vladimir Komarov, a cosmonaut who knew his mission was doomed, crashing to Earth in the middle of the anniversary celebrations for the Soviet Union that the launch was meant to mark. Raw footage of Maoist stage plays from the Cultural Revolution, organised by Qing, give new insights into that upheaval. In a discussion of the changing face of New York, a foreboding shot shows the twin towers in Manhattan glimpsed through a field of dandelion puffs. </p><p >This craftsmanship impresses, though other segments, such as a long scene of ballroom dancers set to modern pop music, are visually sumptuous but largely without a point. The series is often meandering and sometimes even boring. One of Mr Curtis’s verdicts, that collective action and the desire for change are dead, jars in a time of mass protests against racism and other social movements. In Mr Curtis’s own terms, he is a journalist first and a film-maker second: in an <a href="https://www.economist.com/open-future/2018/12/06/the-antidote-to-civilisational-collapse">interview with<em> The Economist</em> in 2018</a> he described himself as a journalist using the medium of film. Yet in “Can’t Get You Out Of My Head”, with its dense visuals but sparse argument, that is not his order of priorities. As a result his project’s lofty ambition is not realised.</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p ><em>“Can’t Get You Out Of My Head” is streaming on BBC iPlayer now</em></p>
