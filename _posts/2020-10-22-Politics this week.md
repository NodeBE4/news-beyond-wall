Jacinda Ardern, the prime minister, has been praised for her handling of the covid-19 outbreak. The centre-right National Party was crushed, taking just 27% of the vote, a defeat it did not envisage when it chose Judith “Crusher” Collins as its leader in July. See <a href="https://www.economist.com/node/21793519">article</a>.</p><p >The authorities in <strong>Thailand</strong> lifted curbs that had been imposed on protests against the government and the role of the monarchy.

The killer, who was shot by police, acted after a parent condemned Mr Paty on social media for showing his pupils caricatures of the Prophet Muhammad in a lesson on free speech. Emmanuel Macron ordered the closure of one Islamist association; police raided several more.

As a supporter of a two-state model, Mr Tatar’s election is likely to set back efforts to unite Cyprus under a power-sharing model.</p><p ><strong>Nigerian </strong>soldiers fired at protesters who were demonstrating against police violence, killing at least a dozen. Thousands have taken to the streets in recent weeks calling on the government to disband a police unit responsible for murder, torture and theft.

Financial aid was the sticking point. Andy Burnham, Manchester’s mayor, said the amount of money his city had been offered was “brutal”. South Yorkshire was also placed in tier 3. See <a href="https://www.economist.com/node/21793468">article</a>.</p><p >Michel Barnier, the <small>EU</small>’s negotiator with Britain on a post-<strong>Brexit</strong> trade pact, claimed a deal was “within reach” but acknowledged that compromises were needed on both sides. This came after Mr Johnson declared that time had run out. The talks resumed.
