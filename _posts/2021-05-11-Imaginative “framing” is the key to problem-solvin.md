WH Allen; £20</em></p><p >WHEN INGVAR KAMPRAD (pictured) founded IKEA, a furniture company, in 1943, it was customary to suppose that items such as desks and tables must be built to last. But the 17-year-old Kamprad had noticed that many companies had lately started creating cheap, disposable versions of everyday goods. Importing their example into the fusty Swedish furniture business, he made it his mission to sell designs that were affordable and pleasing rather than stately and timeless.</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p >For the authors of “Framers”, a paean to cognitive agility and the elasticity of the imagination, this is one of many instructive stories of a smart thinker boldly reconceiving the familiar. Viktor Mayer-Schönberger, a specialist in internet governance at Oxford University, has previously collaborated with Kenneth Cukier, an editor at <em>The Economist</em>, on “Big Data: A Revolution That Will Transform How We Live, Work and Think”. Here the pair team up with Francis de Véricourt, a professor of management science, for what is billed as “the first guide to mastering an essential skill for the 21st century”—namely the capacity to recognise what lens you are applying to a problem, grasp its limitations and marshal alternatives.</p><p >Frames are “cognitive templates”: mental models which package the chaos of sensory information in manageable ways. Religion and secular humanism are frames, as are racism and anti-racism, democracy and the #MeToo movement. Framing is the act of harnessing and choosing between such models: those who are adept at it “see the world not as it is, but as it can be”.</p><p >By their own admission, the authors pay little attention to the cognitive processes involved in this. They provide a broad account of the relationship between the perception of cause and effect, the ability to picture alternative realities and the need to regulate such imaginings. But large parts of the book consist of assertions about the value of recasting problems in novel terms, or of motivational stories about people who have done so.</p><p >The anecdotes are enjoyable—their heroes as disparate as Charles Darwin, Elon Musk, President John F. Kennedy and Sarah Cooper, a comedian celebrated for her lip-syncing impersonations of Donald Trump. Still, the assertions can be mundane: “Tapping the imagination greatly increases…the chance to find a solution that’s really good.”</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p >Metaphor does a lot of heavy lifting, not always to Herculean effect. Frames are a “cognitive Swiss Army knife”, yet also constitute “a vast tapestry”. The bad ones have “carcasses”; the handy ones “help”, “undergird”, “liberate” and “impose boundaries”; new ones “are revolutionary” but in many cases “peacefully coexist with the old”. Sometimes the authors risk seeming glib. Reflecting on the effects of covid-19 in Britain and New Zealand, they sound as if they’re pitching a disaster movie: “Two countries. Same data, same goals—different frames, different actions. And very different outcomes.” Might there have been reasons for those outcomes besides the dissimilar responses? The way they frame the issue elides this possibility.</p><p >Ultimately, and more convincingly, “Framers” is a plea for diversity in all its forms. It argues for the importance of “frame pluralism”, in which ideas can compete vigorously yet still share space. One of the guidelines with which the book concludes is “promote a commingling of cultures as a way to foster imagination, innovation, and dynamism in a society.” Friction has costs, but it animates political life, philosophical inquiry and also, more immediately, the workplace. The authors suggest that every good team needs a jester.</p><p >At the same time, they worry that intellectual latitude is under threat from zealots stuck in “ideological silos”—emotionalists who feel society has become too reliant on data and analysis, technophiles convinced it would be better to leave decision-making to artificial intelligence. In an age when public debate can feel like a series of theatrical squabbles between tribes who insist on single frames of truth, they draw inspiration from Hannah Arendt, a fearless political theorist who “abhorred the monoculture of mental models”, particularly in autocratic societies. The alternative, for them as for her, is always to think wide as well as deep.</p><p >HENRY HITCHINGS*</p><p ><strong>*Our policy is to identify the reviewer of any book by or about someone closely connected with <em>The Economist. </em>Henry Hitchings is a reviewer, critic and author.
