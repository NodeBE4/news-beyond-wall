Feeding for the first time, her piglets act on instinct alone, nudging and climbing over one another. Gunda does not intervene: she lays still and lets them figure it out. The sequence is an apt visual metaphor for the film itself, which refuses to impose a narrative or even a voice-over on the creatures’ lives. Shying away from didacticism of any kind, “Gunda” lets the viewer decide what to make of it.</p><p >It is challenging to describe what happens in the film, which may have been the director’s intention given his interest in the “mystery of all animal consciousness”. Gunda watches over her piglets as they learn to walk, root and socialise; there are cutaways to other animals, including a one-legged chicken and some cows. Mr Kossakovsky keeps his camera close to the ground so that the viewer shares the perspective of his subjects. Though the animals occasionally look directly into the lens, the film does not try to interpret their expressions. “Gunda” is an invigorating work of visual art that uses only the fundamental tools of cinema—light and motion.</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p >Admittedly, the film is not without some human interference. Mr Kossakovsky laid a dolly track around the barn so that his camera could move smoothly around the animals, and installed lights in Gunda’s sty to brighten the dark corners. Long takes focus on the pigs but the segments about the other animals have a more traditional editing style, which subtly imbues the film, as all edits do, with the director’s point of view. His presence must have influenced the behaviour of the fauna in some way, but the unique character of each animal seems nevertheless to emerge.</p><p >“Gunda” nods to but transcends both nature documentaries and works of animal-rights activism. “Planet Earth” pioneered a style of documentary that offers a passionate anthropomorphisation of its animal subjects, with Sir David Attenborough’s narration, combined with magnificent orchestral scores, manipulating the viewer’s feelings. Animal-rights documentaries, on the other hand, often expose the degradation of the natural world through human protagonists. “The Cove”, which won the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature in 2010, told the story of intrepid investigators who risked their lives to expose dolphin-hunting in Japan. “Blackfish” (2013) used the story of a trainer’s death at SeaWorld to look at killer whales traumatised by their captivity. The focus in “Cowspiracy” (2014) and “Seaspiracy” (2021), two hit documentaries, is on the cost of the human demand for meat and fish. These films are effective—SeaWorld lost $1.7bn in market value in the year after the release of “Blackfish”—but they do little to convey the complexity of animal psychology.</p><p >Even the documentaries that do put animals at the centre of their narratives often focus on their suffering. For example, “Earthlings” (2005), narrated by Joaquin Phoenix (who is also an executive producer of “Gunda”), is composed almost entirely of undercover footage from the food, clothing, entertainment and research industries. “Gunda” features no explicit human cruelty towards animals, who for much of the film appear to live safely and comfortably. When the moment of their ultimate fate arrives, Mr Kossakovsky spares the viewer the carnage, but it is perhaps more harrowing for his restraint. Life seems eternal in the natural rhythms of the farm—until, all of a sudden, it’s not.</p><p >Yet most of the film is spent not in crisis but in communion. For some viewers, “Gunda” may feel slow and uneventful, but it is all the more powerful for its observational, meditative approach. Other films about animals will feel caged in comparison.</p><p ><em>“Gunda” is playing in American cinemas now</em></p>
