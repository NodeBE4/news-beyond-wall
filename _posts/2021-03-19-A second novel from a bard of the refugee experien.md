But Mr Nguyen’s follow-up to the book that won him a Pulitzer prize is less concerned with the charms of the City of Light than with the brutal legacy of colonialism.</p><p >This tall, nutty tale is almost a parody of the gangster genre (one character goes by the moniker “Le Cao Boi”). Vo Danh, psychologically shattered and prone to fits of weeping, falls in with a drug ring and begins selling hashish and heroin. Cartoonish tit-for-tat hostage-taking with a rival gang ensues. After the real-life drama of “The Sympathizer”, which covered the fall of Saigon and a botched counter-revolutionary plot by South Vietnamese officers, this story is smaller and seamier. It functions mainly as a pretext for the author’s zinging takedowns of the hypocrisy of imperial powers.</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p >As a “man of two minds”, torn between France and Vietnam—and between old radical views and a growing repugnance for violence—Vo Danh is the ideal mouthpiece for Mr Nguyen’s indictment of both capitalism and communism. Each, he claims, winds up as a “Repressive State Apparatus”. In one of the most acerbic, amusing scenes, Vo Danh and the bouncer at the gang’s brothel, a Frenchman of Senegalese descent, bond over revolutionary theory, trading insights from Theodor Adorno, Aimé Césaire and especially Frantz Fanon’s “The Wretched of the Earth”.</p><p >Savage humour keeps the reader wincing yet entertained. The author eviscerates everything from Vietnamese culture to male objectification of women to the coloniser’s “beautiful battleship named <em>La Mission Civilisatrice</em>”. His greatest ire is reserved for the “endless, schmaltzy gratitude that host countries demanded of refugees who came from countries raped and bombed by the host countries”. The book is chock-full of one-liners: “Whitewashing the blood-soaked profits of colonisation was the only kind of laundering white men did with their own hands.”</p><p >In his first novel Mr Nguyen held a mirror up to America’s involvement in Vietnam. Now he has done something similar, if less convincingly, for the French. The Eiffel Tower is just a “Gallic erection”, Vo Danh concludes, “the French Empire simply exposing itself for all to see”. Not so different, in this disillusioned view, from the needle of the Washington Monument. <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p><p data-test-id="Footnote" >This article appeared in the Books &amp; arts section of the print edition under the headline &quot;No man’s land&quot;</p>
