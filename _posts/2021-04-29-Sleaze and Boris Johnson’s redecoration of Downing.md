American presidents have everything laid on: expansive living quarters, Air Force One, a personal doctor, cooks galore, along with a theme-park’s-worth of entertainment, including a swimming pool, a tennis court, a bowling alley and a cinema. French presidents have the Elysée Palace, an ample domestic staff, a personal doctor and chef—and, back in François Mitterrand’s time, a conveniently located flat paid for out of the public purse to house the presidential mistress and love-child.</p><p >Britain is equally sensible when it comes to the prime minister’s public role: from the moment he wakes up he is surrounded by officials to help him conduct the business of state. But when it comes to his private life the taps are turned off. The accommodation is cramped. The domestic staff consists of not much more than a cleaner. The most powerful person in the country has to queue up for lunch in a tiny cafeteria or else go upstairs to make a sandwich in his kitchen. After a day running the country he closes the door of his flat only to be faced with all the domestic duties—laundry, cooking and personal admin—that fall to those unburdened with the cares of state.</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p >Should the prime minister wish to lighten his domestic load, he must do so at his own expense, which is particularly hard on the current occupant of Downing Street. Not only has he had more to deal with of late than most—the split with his wife, a new baby with his girlfriend, his near-death from covid and a long convalescence alone in his flat—but he is also probably less flush than most. He has had to finance an expensive divorce (his second) and six children (probably) on the relatively modest prime ministerial salary of £160,000 ($220,000), while having lost his sizeable income as a writer and speaker.</p><p >Britain’s wariness about spending money on the prime minister’s personal needs stems from an admirable instinct: that politicians should be treated as normal citizens rather than as a privileged caste. The country is right to rejoice in the fact that Mr Johnson was treated for covid-19 in a National Health Service hospital rather than in the presidential suite of a military hospital, as Donald Trump was. Wariness also stems from the reasonable belief that frugality should start from the top. William Gladstone, Britain’s greatest liberal prime minister, prided himself on “saving cheese parings and candle wax in the cause of the country”. British prime ministers have no need to embody the majesty of state: that’s the queen’s job.</p><p >Whether the prime minister really needed to spend £58,000 on redecorating his Downing Street flat is doubtful. He is entitled to an annual allowance of £30,000 for refurbishment, but the work was carried out by Lulu Lytle, one of Britain’s most fashionable designers. (The previous decor is said to have smacked of John Lewis, a department store popular with the British middle classes but not, apparently, with the prime minister’s household.) How closely he was involved in browsing the rich colours and Moghul-inspired fabrics in which Ms Lytle specialises has not been revealed; though since he does not have the look of a man who spends a lot of time thinking about sofas and side-lamps, his girlfriend, Carrie Symonds, is assumed to have taken charge.</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p >The prime minister seems to have managed the financing of the redecorations with his usual cavalier shiftiness. They were paid for last year by the Conservative Party, which had been given money for the purpose by a donor, Lord Brownlow. There was talk of setting up a trust for the purpose, but Simon Case, the cabinet secretary, told Parliament that “a charitable trust can’t cover private areas of Downing Street”. Mr Johnson is now said to have paid for the work himself. Mr Case is reviewing the matter, and the Electoral Commission conducting an investigation, which could end up with a criminal prosecution.</p><p >Mr Johnson has already wasted a lot of his valuable time dreaming up financial schemes to pay for a redecoration which, by the standards of most leaders’ makeovers, is rather modest. When Barack Obama and Donald Trump were in office $1.5m and $1.75m, respectively, was splashed out on the White House. He is now going to be wasting even more time answering questions about these schemes. Given the importance of keeping the prime minister’s attention on the job in hand—which, as anybody who has ever worked with him will attest, is a challenge at the best of times—none of this is doing the country much good.</p><h2>Game of sofas</h2><p >Britain’s prejudice against looking after its leaders properly also has a dark side, for it is of a piece with the enjoyment the nation derives from pillorying those with the temerity to succeed. There are times when the British public bears a worrying resemblance to the citizens of Westeros, who pelt their queen, Cersei Lannister, with excrement when she is forced to walk the streets of the town naked. This is hardly a recipe for encouraging the nation’s best people to go into politics, let alone for allowing them to focus on the business of statecraft.</p><p >Britain’s system of government has become increasingly presidential: exhaust or distract the prime minister and the whole thing freezes. But it still bears the imprint of the old days when the prime minister was no more than <em>primus inter pares</em> and work ceased when he closed the door of his flat at night. The country needs to pay less attention to the arcane details of Mr Johnson’s furnishings and more to the challenge of modernising the system that supports him: to create a blind trust to look after Downing Street, to staff his residence so that he can focus on the state of the nation rather than that of his shirts, and to raise his salary so that he does not need to worry about money. All this would provoke jeers and fury, but the country will benefit if it does a better job of looking after the man who is supposed to look after it.<span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p><p ><em>A version of this article was published online on April 28th, 2021</em></p><p data-test-id="Footnote" >This article appeared in the Britain section of the print edition under the headline &quot;Domestic politics&quot;</p>
