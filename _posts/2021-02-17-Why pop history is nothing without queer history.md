Inflammatory slogans were then very much the band’s stock-in-trade, but this one captured something no other did, and has endured longer than the rest. There is a truth to it that is essential rather than literal. You might add to it the qualifier: “if it’s any good.”</p><p >It doesn’t mean the performers are gay, although many have been. It means that infused in the imagery and appeal of the most memorable and influential popular music from the rock’n’roll era onwards is a powerful aura of what is today called queerness. “Queer”, lately reclaimed from the slur, is a nebulous term; usefully so. It embraces a spectrum of sexualities and identities united only by being non-heterosexual. “Queer” has also come to describe a sensibility that has permeated pop music for decades, whether through the peacocking of rock’n’roll’s early stars or the “gender-bending” acts that followed them.</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p >A new book, “The Velvet Mafia: The Gay Men Who Ran The Swinging Sixties” by Darryl Bullock, covers one especially vital period: the emergence of Britain as an epicentre of global pop culture in the wake of The Beatles. Mr Bullock focuses on a coterie of impresarios and their associates without whom this would have been impossible: Larry Parnes, who controlled a stable of young rock’n’rollers including Tommy Steele, Billy Fury and Vince Eager; Robert Stigwood, the manager of Eric Clapton and The Bee Gees, who would go on to produce the films “Saturday Night Fever” and “Grease”; the revolutionary record producer Joe Meek; David Jacobs, an entertainment lawyer; Kit Lambert, co-manager of, and formative artistic influence on, The Who; Lionel Bart, a songwriter; Simon Napier-Bell, the future manager of Wham!; and most significantly of all, Brian Epstein (pictured), without whom The Beatles might well have remained no more than a local Liverpudlian phenomenon. </p><p >These men all knew one another well. Most did business together. Their ideas, tastes and visions would be central in guiding pop music through the 1960s. Each had an eye (and ear) for what would appeal to the young and they possessed the sophistication to refine it, package it and then sell it. Mr Bullock opens his book with a quotation from Alan Blaikley and Ken Howard, a successful songwriting duo in the 1960s: “Pop promotion sought to glamourise testosterone-fuelled boy bands and make them appealing to young girls. Is it unsurprising that many of those behind the scenes were gay? Who better to know where attraction lay?” (There’s a tacit acknowledgement here of how the music business at the time had as few women in positions of influence as most other fields.) When Epstein first saw The Beatles play at the Cavern Club, he had no interest in pop music beyond selling it in his record shop. He was spellbound by the allure, energy and charisma of good-looking young men making a racket in a basement. He put them into suits, imposed a regimen of professionalism upon them and induced them to play in a way that would thrill a teenage audience and charm its parents.</p><p >Queerness had been crucial to rock’n’roll from its earliest American days. The pre-rock’n’roll showmanship of Liberace, a pianist, and Johnny Ray, a singer (who would become Parnes’s lover) were among its unacknowledged raw materials. Liberace’s over-the-top stage act and appearance and Mr Ray’s willingness to transgress the boundaries of traditional masculinity with displays of emotional vulnerability would help shape the acts to come. Little Richard, a former drag queen, would have an impact just as enduring and even more radical than that of Elvis Presley. He was lurid and flamboyant, radiating a sexual charge much more ambiguous than Presley’s, and his music was wilder by an order of magnitude.</p><p >It wasn’t until the early 1970s that it became acceptable—fashionable, even—to make queerness overt; plainly visible on the stage rather than operating behind it. By then it was too late for Epstein, Jacobs and Meek, all of whom had met tragic ends inextricable from the social stigma of their sexuality. But try to imagine a pop history of the period without David Bowie, Marc Bolan, Lou Reed (whose hugely influential band, The Velvet Underground, had been protégés of Andy Warhol), Freddie Mercury or Elton John. This queer history was chiefly a male history, and would remain so until the supremacy of disco, a genre that was largely gay or bisexual, non-white and female-fronted (and which would be the subject of a racist and homophobic hit job in the form of the “Disco Sucks!” campaign).</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p >Four decades on from the orchestrated demise of disco, the pop landscape is very different. Many of the Velvet Mafia suffered terribly for being who they were; today it is relatively unexceptional to be a queer artist. It is surely a positive sign when an openly queer act might be one of the most exciting and intriguing (Ezra Furman, for instance), or the most unexceptionably mainstream (such as Sam Smith). That is not to say that prejudice has evaporated. But queerness in pop no longer need operate by subterfuge: it can, at last, occupy centre stage. </p><p ><strong>The Velvet Mafia: The Gay Men Who Ran the Swinging Sixties. </strong>By Darryl Bullock. <em>Omnibus Press; 368 pages; £20</em></p>
