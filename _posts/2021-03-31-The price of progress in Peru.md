Translated by Annie McDermott. <em>Granta; 208 pages; £12<br/></em></p><p data-caps="initial" ><span data-caps="initial">O</span><small>SMAN CUÑACHí</small> was practising free kicks one afternoon in 2016 when thick black oil from a crack in a nearby pipeline started oozing into the Chiriaco river. The 11-year-old member of the Awajún tribe, the second-largest indigenous nation in Peru, heard that government engineers were paying people to clean up the spill. His family was one of dozens who waded into the water with buckets and plastic bottles. Sick from the fumes, his four-year-old brother was the first to give up. Osman stayed in until it got dark, hoping to earn enough to buy a smartphone. In a photo taken that day he is covered in black smears, smiling and swinging his bucket.</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p >“It’s a perverse paradox of development that something as horrific as an oil spill and the death of a river could temporarily benefit a town,” writes Joseph Zárate, a Peruvian journalist, in “Wars of the Interior”<em>. </em>Each of his chapters investigates how a commodity extracted from the rainforest—wood, gold, oil—has changed the lives of the locals, mostly for the worse. Mr Zárate acknowledges that these industries have helped Peru and its Amazonian neighbours grow and modernise. But, he argues, too little thought has been given to the trade-offs. Rifts in Peruvian society over the exploitation of natural resources too often end in violence. A war is raging between “clashing visions of progress”, and indigenous people are losing. </p><p >Many books about the Amazon cast its inhabitants as passive victims, or idealise them as guardians of the forest. Mr Zárate does neither. His subjects don’t oppose development itself—Osman’s father wants him to become a petroleum engineer—but rather the brutal way it has intruded on their lives. They are resilient and stubborn, but they are clearly outgunned. An Asháninka chief sees no choice but to fight illegal loggers who are chopping down trees on his tribe’s reserve. He gets killed. A Quechua potato farmer can’t imagine selling her land for a pittance so that a mining company can dredge up a yellow metal of no value to her. Her house is burned down. Doctors find dangerous arsenic, lead and mercury in little Osman’s blood. He just wants to be “a normal kid, and not be scared of getting a tumour one day”.</p><p >Though Mr Zárate’s findings could fill scathing exposés of the kind churned out by Greenpeace, his technique is more like that of Svetlana Alexievich, the Belarusian writer who was awarded the Nobel prize for literature in 2015. A quote from one of her booksstands as the epigraph to “Wars of the Interior”: “I strive desperately to…reduce history to the human being.” Like Ms Alexievich’s narratives, Mr Zárate’s relies heavily on his subjects’ own words. Like her, he focuses on the failure of the state to protect its people. </p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p >In Peru extraction companies operate in 70% of the rainforest. Many ignore clauses in their contracts about respecting local people but few are held to account. Though the World Bank estimates that 80% of Peru’s wood exports have illegal origins, only a handful of loggers have ever been sent to prison for illegally felling trees. In the past decade, meanwhile, more than two Olympic swimming pools-worth of oil has leaked into the country’s rivers. Mr Zárate forces readers to confront the human implications of development. “Osman Cuñachí doesn’t understand much about environmental politics,” he writes (in Annie McDermott’s translation), “but he does know how hard it is to clean oil off your body.”</p><p >Economic development can no doubt be pursued more carefully, but its force seems to be unstoppable, just like the flood that destroyed the Amazonian village where Mr Zárate’s grandmother grew up in the 1940s. She left to work as a maid in Lima, as thousands of indigenous women still do each year. She married at 14, adapted her speech in order to assimilate into urban society and saved enough money to send all her children to university. To some, hers is an uplifting story. Mr Zárate isn’t so sure: “The question is what we are prepared to sacrifice, as individuals and as a society,” in the name of progress. <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p><p data-test-id="Footnote" >This article appeared in the Books &amp; arts section of the print edition under the headline &quot;The wood from the trees&quot;</p>
