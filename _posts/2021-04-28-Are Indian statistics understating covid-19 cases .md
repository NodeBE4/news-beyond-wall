With 350,000 people now testing positive every day, it accounts for almost half the recorded global rise in covid-19 cases. India’s official death toll has topped 200,000 and keeps rising by more than 3,000 a day. Yet experts, backed by reports from journalists, insist that <a href="https://www.economist.com/asia/2021/04/24/india-is-struggling-with-a-catastrophic-second-wave">India’s crisis is far bigger</a> than even those numbers suggest. The real caseload could be ten or even 30 times higher (see chart), and the number of deaths much more, too. Could India’s official statistics really be so drastically understating the scale of the pandemic?</p><div ><figure><div itemscope="" itemProp="image" itemType="https://schema.org/ImageObject" data-slim="1"><meta itemProp="url" content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/768/90/sites/default/files/images/2021/04/blogs/economist-explains/20210501_woc039_0.png"/><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/768/90/sites/default/files/images/2021/04/blogs/economist-explains/20210501_woc039_0.png"  sizes="300px" alt=""/></div></figure><p >As so often in this vast, varied and still overwhelmingly poor country of 1.4bn, the answer is complex. At the best of times India has a weak system for reporting deaths. Around 10m Indians die every year, but national statistics for “all-cause mortality”, the obvious baseline for calculating the impact of an epidemic, tend to be issued only after a two-year delay. In normal times one in seven deaths is never registered, and of those that are, just 22% cite a cause certified by a doctor. There are also huge differences in reporting. A few states, such as Kerala, keep accurate records, but most do not. </p><p >The pandemic has complicated things further. In most states, deaths are not attributed to covid-19 without a recent positive test result. But testing, especially outside big cities, is not widespread. Even with more than 1.5m Indians now getting tested each day, the rate of testing relative to population is still less than a tenth of that in Britain, for example. And because of the surge in cases, labs even in Delhi, India’s capital, are overwhelmed. They now take days to deliver results; many die without knowing they are positive, or after getting a false negative.</p><p >Fully one-third of tests are coming back positive in Delhi, and 21% across India as a whole, proportions high enough to convince epidemiologists that more testing would reveal many more cases. Sero-surveys, blood tests which measure how many people have been infected with covid in the past, reveal a huge gap, too. A national one in December, when India was reporting a cumulative total of 10m covid-19 cases, suggested that the real number was closer to 300m. And journalists from across India investigating local records from crematoria, cemeteries and even newspaper obituaries have found many times more covid-19 deaths than appear in official health bulletins.</p><p >Politics <a href="https://www.economist.com/leaders/2021/04/24/indias-giant-second-wave-is-a-disaster-for-it-and-the-world">plays an obvious role</a>. The rival parties running different states want to keep their own numbers down. Narendra Modi, the prime minister, does not want voters to tie covid-19 deaths to events he promoted even as infections soared, such as big religious festivals and election rallies. Between administrative incapacity and political manipulation, the real number of covid-19 cases or victims in India may never be known. Official records from the time of the Spanish flu of 1918-20 suggest that it killed 6m people in India. Only when historians took a closer look at other sources, including census figures, did they conclude the real count was possibly three times higher. </p></div>
