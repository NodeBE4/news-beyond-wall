Just now the airport of Vnukovo is closed for technical reasons…” It was met with hoots of laughter and ironic clapping from passengers and journalists on board. Then came the voice of a passenger in row 13. “I offer my apologies to everyone,” boomed Alexei Navalny, Russia’s leading opposition politician, who had chosen Pobeda (“Victory”), a low-cost airline, for his return flight to Russia from Berlin. For the past five months he has been recovering there after a medical evacuation, following his poisoning with the nerve agent Novichok. It was never going to be a smooth flight.<br/><br/>The “technical reason” for the closure of Vnukovo was the 2,000-strong crowd of Mr Navalny’s supporters who had gathered to greet him. The Kremlin had no appetite for images of a hero’s welcome being flashed around social media, and even less for letting Mr Navalny through. So it diverted the Pobeda plane to Sheremetyevo airport, closing it off to traffic just to be on the safe side. As Mr Navalny walked through the terminal, accompanied by his wife and followed by a gaggle of journalists, he stopped beside a bright poster of the Kremlin for an impromptu press conference. “I am not afraid…this is the happiest day for the past five months of my life,” he declared. “I have come home.”<br/><br/>With that Mr Navalny proceeded to passport control. “You must have missed me. I missed you,” he grinned at the officer behind the glass. The officer called the police and Mr Navalny was led away “to clarify a few questions.” As soon as the airport had been cleared of his supporters, he was moved in secret to a police detention-centre. His lawyers were denied access to him; and he was not allowed even a telephone call. The Kremlin’s operation was well under way. <br/><br/>It has conducted similar operations before—with the expropriation of Yukos, Russia’s largest oil company, through a phoney outfit registered at a vodka bar’s address outside Moscow and the farcical show trial of Mikhail Khodorkovsky, its owner, who was accused of stealing the entire volume of physical crude from his own firm. <br/><br/>The arrest has turned Mr Navalny into political prisoner number one, Mr Putin into a vengeful dictator and Russia into a land where the Kremlin feels free to abuse the law. It has also produced a quick international reaction. In sharp contrast to the striking silence of President Donald Trump’s White House, Jake Sullivan, Joe Biden’s incoming national security adviser, tweeted a statement: “Mr Navalny should be immediately released, and the perpetrators of the outrageous attack on his life must be held accountable.” Amnesty International has declared Mr Navalny a “prisoner of conscience”. Sergei Lavrov, Russia’s foreign minister, said the West was simply trying to “divert attention from the crisis of the liberal model”.<br/><br/>The wheels of Russia’s Kafkaesque justice system went on turning unhindered. The following day, January 18th, at 12.29pm, Mr Navalny’s lawyers were told he was to stand trial inside the police station where he is being held—at 12.30pm sharp. Inside a hastily arranged courtroom, Mr Navalny managed to record a video: “I don’t understand what is happening. A minute ago I was led from a cell for a meeting with my lawyer. I came here and was told that a court proceeding is taking place here…. I’ve seen a lot of mockery of justice, but this time [Vladimir Putin, the Russian president] in his bunker is so afraid of everything that he has demonstrably torn into pieces Russia’s criminal code and thrown it into a dump.” This time, the (presumably unintended) backdrop to Mr Navalny’s video was a portrait of Genrikh Yagoda, the head of the NKVD, Stalin’s secret police, who was behind the “troika” trials of the 1930s and who was himself executed by his successors. <br/><br/>The formal excuse for detaining Mr Navalny is a good illustration of Russia’s lawlessness. He is accused by Russia’s prison service of breaking the probation rules of a suspended sentence that was handed out to him in an embezzlement case in 2014 and had the effect of barring him from politics. That case was subsequently overturned by the European Court of Human Rights, an arm of the Council of Europe to which Russia belongs, though Russia has refused to accept the court’s authority in this matter.<br/><br/>Of course, the reason why Mr Navalny could not report to the police station as required was that he was recovering in Germany from the effects of Novichok poisoning, allegedly ordered by the Kremlin and carried out by its operatives. His trial for “breaking probation rules” is scheduled for January 29th. Mr Navalny returned ahead of that date in the hope of having a few days at liberty on Russian soil to rally his supporters. But the Kremlin had no intention of allowing that. Less than 24 hours after he landed only to be arrested, the court delivered a verdict: Mr Navalny was jailed for 30 days. Long before that sentence expires, his probation trial will have taken place. It seems almost certain that the court in that case will decide to make his suspended sentence, to three and a half years in prison, into an actual one. And beyond that, the Kremlin is working on another embezzlement charge, which could get him an additional ten years behind bars. <br/><br/>The Kremlin’s fury is palpable. Not only did Mr Navalny survive an assassination attack, but he went on to expose the FSB, the successor to the NKVD and the KGB, as having carried out the attempt, and directly accused Mr Putin of ordering his murder. The Kremlin would doubtless have preferred to marginalise Mr Navalny by turning him into an exile abroad, as it did with Mr Khodorkovsky, who was deported to Germany after spending a decade in jail in Russia. But Mr Navalny has denied them this luxury, radicalising Russian politics and escalating his struggle against Mr Putin to the wire. Will that work? With Europe and America now likely to be forced by Mr Putin’s excesses into tougher action, the Kremlin’s tactics could well backfire. <br/><br/>In an early and still relatively candid interview, Mr Putin once recalled a telling incident from his youth. On the dirty staircase of a Leningrad apartment block, he and his friends were chasing rats with sticks. One rat, pushed into a corner and with nowhere to go, jumped at him. “It was very unexpected and very scary.” Now, as then, Mr Putin has only himself to blame. With Mr Navalny in jail, Mr Putin may be physically in control of his freedom and indeed his life. But the Russian dictator may have opened himself up for a nasty surprise. Mr Navalny has now called his supporters onto the streets on January 23rd. “Don&#x27;t be afraid. Take to the streets! Take to the streets not for my sake, but for your own sake and [for the sake of] your future!” he said.</p>
