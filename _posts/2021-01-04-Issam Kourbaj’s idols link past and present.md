They were among hundreds of statuettes—dubbed “eye idols”—retrieved in the early 20th century in a monumental building in Tell Brak, an ancient city in north-eastern Syria. Some idols are thought to represent a single person; others are engraved with multiple eyes, perhaps for a couple or a family. In Mesopotamian art, eyes symbolised fidelity to the gods and the number and size of the idols suggests that they were left in the building as votives or tributes, perhaps standing in for the person who dedicated them. </p><p >During the lockdown in Britain in the spring of 2020, the Fitzwilliam approached Issam Kourbaj, a Syrian-born artist, to take part in a podcast series called “In My Mind’s Eye”. Five artists and writers, including Ali Smith and Jackie Kay, were invited to talk about the ways works of art can continue to exist in the memory and imagination even when museums are closed. Mr Kourbaj immediately thought of the three idols, “printed at the back of my eyes like a camera obscura”, in the museum’s own A.G. Leventis Gallery of Ancient Cyprus. “Their unforgettable and mesmerising gaze moved me,” he says. “I thought there was something very tender about them”. The idols brought back memories of his family.</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p >Mr Kourbaj decided to create his own version of the objects. Since the start of the Syrian civil war in March 2011, his artwork has focused on the suffering of his fellow Syrians and the destruction of the country’s cultural heritage. He chose to carve his figurines out of laurel-scented Aleppo soap as a nod to public-health messages during the pandemic, but also to the war and Mesopotamian history (the material was invented thousands of years ago in the city of Aleppo). “Wash your hands,” Mr Kourbaj says, “but, equally, don’t wash your hands—don’t wash your hands of Syria.” </p><div ><figure><div itemscope="" itemProp="image" itemType="https://schema.org/ImageObject" data-slim="1"><meta itemProp="url" content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/784/90/sites/default/files/images/2021/01/blogs/prospero/20210109_bkp501.jpg"/><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/784/90/sites/default/files/images/2021/01/blogs/prospero/20210109_bkp501.jpg"  sizes="300px" alt=""/></div></figure><p >Sitting at his bench in his studio in Cambridge, Mr Kourbaj carved 100 figurines using a pocket knife. He was dissatisfied as “they were beautiful, but they didn’t talk to me.” He wanted to respond to the Tell Brak idols rather than merely copy them, and so he decided to work blindfolded in order to achieve “something more spontaneous, more innocent. There is a vulnerability to the objects that becomes much clearer: they become asymmetrical, injured—the trauma becomes more evident.” With this new method, he patiently carved 366 tiny eye idols, one for every day in a leap year. In his mind, the three ancient idols represent the leap years that have passed since the civil war began.</p><p >At the Fitzwilliam—which, now closed due to the coronavirus restrictions, has made the work available to view online—the ancient and contemporary idols sit alongside each other. “Don’t Wash Your Hands”, as Mr Kourbaj’s soap idols are called, is the artist’s second collaboration with the museum. “Dark Water, Burning World” (2017) was a collection of 1,000 miniature boats made from the discarded mudguards of bicycles and filled with burned matchsticks. The sculptures were inspired by three model ships dating from 400–300BC and found in Syria. This fragile “flotilla”, depicting refugees fleeing their homeland, was recently chosen as Object 101 in the British Museum’s “A History Of The World in 100 Objects” radio series, broadcast in December 2020 on BBC Radio 4. (After stints in institutions including the Fitzwilliam and Kettle’s Yard, the installation is now part of the British Museum’s permanent collection.) </p><p >Mr Kourbaj’s work has also been widely exhibited and collected elsewhere, including by the Victoria and Albert museum, the Museum of Classical Archaeology, Penn museum in Philadelphia and the Brooklyn museum. “Dark Water, Burning World” was displayed at the Venice Biennial in 2019. “Issues such as migration and population mobility after a period of conflict have shaped the ancient Mediterranean world and continue to shape our world today: the decade-long conflict in Syria, the migrant crisis in the Mediterranean, the political debates around Europe as a response to those events and of course, here at home, Brexit,” says Anastasia Christofilopoulou, a curator at the Fitzwilliam. Mr Kourbaj’s work “makes us think about these phenomena”.</p><p >The curious and compelling soap sculptures demand the viewer take a closer look. In creating the eye idols, Mr Kourbaj has offered up a tribute “to the Syrians who are still unable to see the light or breathe the air of freedom”.</p></div><p ><em>“Don’t Wash Your Hands” can be viewed online <a href="https://www.economist.comhttps://beta.fitz.ms/objects-and-artworks/dont-wash-your-hands-neither-light-agrees-to-enter-the-eyes-nor-air-the-lungs-2020">here</a>.
