On May 4th 2009 Donald Trump, then a real-estate developer and reality-television star, posted his first-ever tweet, promoting his forthcoming appearance on the “Late Show with David Letterman”. “Be sure to tune in and watch,” he wrote. In the 11-plus years that followed, Mr Trump tweeted more than 46,000 times, or roughly 77 times per week, on average, before his account was permanently suspended on January 9th for breaking Twitter’s rules against inciting violence.</p><p >Mr Trump’s activity on the platform fluctuated considerably over the years. He tweeted just 142 times in 2010 and 772 times in 2011; in 2012, after embracing the bogus conspiracy theory that Barack Obama was born outside the United States, he posted to the account 3,523 times; by 2013 he was up to 8,128 tweets, or 156 a week. But the rigours of the presidency eventually took their toll. After the election in 2016 Mr Trump’s social-media activity plummeted. He did not return to his previous level of output until 2020, when he tweeted 6,280 times and retweeted 5,956 times, more than in any other year.</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-1"></div></div></div><figure><div itemscope="" itemProp="image" itemType="https://schema.org/ImageObject" data-slim="0"><meta itemProp="url" content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/762/90/sites/default/files/images/2021/01/articles/body/20210116_woc416.png"/><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/762/90/sites/default/files/images/2021/01/articles/body/20210116_woc416.png"  sizes="(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw" alt=""/></div></figure><p >His tone has changed, too, according to an analysis by <em>The Economist</em>. Using a lexicon of 14,182 English words compiled by Saif Mohammad and Peter Turney, two Canadian computer scientists, we counted the number of words in Mr Trump’s 46,694 tweets associated with particular emotions, such as surprise or sadness.</p><p >By this measure, joyful terms initially outnumbered fearful and angry ones; in 2015 they did so by a ratio of two to one. But anger and fear consistently won out by 2018—a year in which Mr Trump taunted North Korea’s dictator, Kim Jong Un, over the size of his “nuclear button”, warned Iran’s president Hassan Rouhani not to threaten America lest he “suffer consequences”, and raged against the “witch-hunt” led by Robert Mueller, the special counsel. Since then, by our count, angry and fearful words have totalled 9,152 and 9,173, respectively—and joyous ones just 7,483. His fiercest tweet came in September 2020, just weeks before the election, when he denounced America’s mail-in voting system as a “scam”.</p><br><hr><div>获取更多RSS：<br><a href="https://feedx.net" style="color:orange" target="_blank">https://feedx.net</a> <br><a href="https://feedx.xyz" style="color:orange" target="_blank">https://feedx.xyz</a><br></div>
