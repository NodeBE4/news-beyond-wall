The terminology softened long ago: bonds that are not of investment grade used to be called “junk” but are now labelled high-yield or speculative-grade. The neighbours are a lot classier, too. Renault, Kraft Heinz and Marks &amp; Spencer are among the well-known firms to have lost their investment-grade status. It is likely that 2020 will set a record for the value of such “fallen angel” debt.</p><p >Companies had sold around $1.5trn of investment-grade bonds by the end of the third quarter—enough to ensure that 2020 will also be a record year for bond issuance. Firms also exploited their bank-credit lines to the limit. Overall, business debt in America rose from 75% to 90% of GDP in the first half of 2020.</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p >After the binge, the hangover. The huge rise in corporate leverage combined with an uncertain economic outlook increases the chances that debts will not be repaid in full or on time. Bond defaults have already picked up sharply. By early October the 12-month trailing rate of default on junk bonds had risen to 6.3% in America and 4.3% in Europe, according to s&amp;p, a rating agency. More defaults will follow in 2021. </p><p >How bad things get depends on a tussle of opposing forces. One is the virus and its lingering effects. Almost no one expects the economy to have fully recovered by the end of 2021. In October, in its twice-yearly World Economic Outlook, the IMF forecast that America’s GDP will return to its 2019 level only in 2022. Already it is clear in Europe that the rebound in activity from the trough of recession in March and April is losing momentum, because of a resurgence of infections. A faltering recovery puts more corporate-bond issuers at risk of default.</p><p >Yet there are powerful influences working in the other direction. One is fiscal policy. The various government-led short-time working schemes, furloughs and support programmes have helped keep a lot of financially stressed companies alive. A big concern is that fiscal stimulus will be withdrawn too abruptly, as it was in Europe after the global financial crisis of 2007-09. But lessons have been learned. The establishment of a euro-area Recovery Fund is one encouraging sign. Early indications from France, Germany and Italy suggest that fiscal policy will remain broadly supportive in 2021. And further stimulus is on the way in America, one way or another.</p><p >A second factor is bond-market liquidity. The burst of issuance during 2020 owed a lot to America’s Federal Reserve, which said in March that it stood ready to buy corporate bonds, prompting investors to start buying bonds in anticipation. The markets unfroze. Big firms could raise plenty of cash to tide them over. Rich-world central banks, including the Fed, are committed to keeping monetary policy extremely loose. And investors will buy new corporate-bond issues, and roll over old ones, if only for the lack of good alternatives. Yields on government bonds are vanishingly small in America. In Europe the safest bonds have negative yields. Corporate bonds are riskier, but have higher yields to compensate.</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p >Credit is the lifeblood of the economy. As long as firms can borrow, they can survive. That is why the corporate-bond market sets the tone for riskier assets, such as shares. There will be more corporate defaults, thanks to a weak recovery and high debt. But cheap money and fiscal support will keep a lot of big firms alive that would otherwise go to the wall. Defaults will peak at lower levels than seemed possible in the spring of 2020. The angels that have already fallen will not be further disgraced. A few may even find redemption in 2021.<span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p><p ><em>This article appeared in the Finance section of the print edition of The World in 2021 under the headline “After the fall”</em></p>
