The church that has become her workshop is located high in the Apennine mountains and Italy is in the grip of an uncharacteristically chilly spring; it is so cold in the building that, every so often, Ms Lapucci loses the circulation in her fingers. Though locals in Monte Santa Maria Tiberina believe the statue has miraculous powers, it is of limited artistic value. Stripped of her typical blonde tresses and blue cloak, the Madonna bears a disconcerting resemblance to Sinead O’Connor.</p><p >Yet Ms Lapucci is treating it with the same exquisite care she would use for the Old Masters undergoing restoration at her studio outside Florence. She offered to work on the Madonna for free after she and her business partner, Jane Adams, a Briton, secured a contract from the mayor to run the Bourbon Del Monte castle-museum next to the church as an art-studies centre. Initially suspicious of the outsiders, local women have taken to bringing them a cake every day and sneaking a look at what Ms Lapucci is doing to “their” Madonna.</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p >The thousand or so inhabitants of Monte Santa Maria Tiberina are understandably proud of their remote and beautiful town, which for more than four centuries was the capital of a microstate, the Marquisate of Monte Santa Maria. Sandwiched between the Papal State and the Grand Duchy of Tuscany, until 1815 the Marquisate issued its own coins, dispensed its own justice and was among the few places in Europe where you could stage a duel to the death without fear of prosecution or excommunication from the Catholic church (at least not by the ecclesiastical authorities of the Marquisate).</p><p >The most notable ruler of this minute territory, Cardinal Francesco Maria Bourbon del Monte, was arguably the most influential patron of Michelangelo Merisi, better known as Caravaggio. He gave the young Caravaggio board and lodging in Rome and is thought to have acted as the painter’s protector in later life. Del Monte bought or commissioned some of Caravaggio’s greatest early works and they now hang in the world’s foremost art institutions. It was from what is now the castle-museum that Del Monte governed the Marquisate from 1615 to 1626.</p><p >That is one reason why Ms Lapucci, who has written several books on Caravaggio, was drawn to the town. Another is covid. She and her associate were colleagues at an international school where she ran the art-restoration department and Ms Adams was responsible for outreach. When the pandemic struck, Ms Lapucci was furloughed; her friend was laid off.</p><p >Ms Lapucci needed somewhere to house her archive, built up over 35 years, of letters, photographs, diagnostic analyses, reports on restoration and provenance and documentation regarding works by Caravaggio in private hands. Ms Adams had been asked to find a home for a vast contemporary art collection, left by the late Richard Fremantle, an American art historian who lived in Florence. Since Caravaggio is often regarded as the “first modern artist”, bringing the archive and collection together had a certain logic. The new research centre will go by the name of Caravaggio &amp; Contemporary.</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p >The two women have financed the project themselves with support from the town council, but will seek partnerships and sponsorships to fund some of their future activities. They have secured the collaboration of the IMT School for Advanced Studies in Lucca, which has sent post-graduate students of cultural heritage to help catalogue the Fremantle collection. The Caravaggio Foundation of Malta has undertaken to transfer its archive to the castle-museum. And links have been forged with universities in America and China which plan to send aspiring restorers to the castle to study under the guidance of Ms Lapucci.</p><p >“In addition, we hope to have art and photography classes and courses in archival studies,” says Ms Adams. She also plans to loan works from the Fremantle collection for exhibition in other parts of Europe—comprising around 500 paintings and 200 sculptures, it includes works by Élisabeth Chaplin, Harry Jackson and Ben Long. Although parts of the castle-museum are still being restored, a conference on Fremantle’s collecting is scheduled for July and a symposium on “Caravaggio’s Women” is planned for September.</p><p >Several organisations, notably the Fondazione Roberto Longhi in Florence, conduct research into Caravaggio’s painting (though none, apart from the Malta-based Caravaggio Foundation, appear to have it as their sole focus). In 2017 the Galleria Borghese in Rome announced the creation, funded by the Fendi fashion house, of a Caravaggio Research Institute that was to have opened in 2020. But the project is currently suspended. With the advantage of a storied location, Caravaggio &amp; Contemporary has the opportunity to fill a gap.</p>
