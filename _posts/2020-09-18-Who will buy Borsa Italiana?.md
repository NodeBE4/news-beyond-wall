Yet considerations that are not purely commercial are likely to determine who wins the London Stock Exchange’s auction of Borsa Italiana. The <small>LSE</small> is selling the Italian stock exchange in order to ensure regulatory approval of its takeover of Refinitiv, a financial-data provider that it agreed to buy last year for $27bn. The bidder least likely to upset European politicians and regulators seems likely to prevail, rather than the one offering the most dosh.</p><p >There are three suitors on the scene. The highest bidder is reportedly Switzerland’s <small>SIX</small>, a Zürich-based stock exchange which brings a big war chest and a strong credit rating to the party. (A spokesman for <small>SIX</small> did not confirm the offer.) The mooted price is €3.4bn ($4bn)—and could go higher. Deutsche Börse, Germany’s main stock exchange, made a non-binding offer to buy Borsa Italiana on September 11th. Euronext followed suit with its offer on September 14th. The Paris-based exchange, which has already hoovered up bourses in Amsterdam, Brussels, Dublin, Lisbon and Oslo, has teamed up with Cassa Depositi e Prestiti Equity (<small>CDP</small>), a bank controlled by the Italian state that invests the country’s postal savings, and Intesa Sanpaolo, Italy’s biggest bank, to buy Borsa.</p><div  id="gpt-ad-slot-1" data-test-id="Inline Ad"></div><p >The <small>LSE</small> has owned both the Milan-based exchange and <small>MTS</small>, the Borsa group’s bond-trading platform, since 2007. It had no plans to sell until the European Commission in June began sniffing around its planned takeover of Refinitiv. Brussels frets that a combined firm could wield significant market power in the electronic trading of European sovereign bonds and derivatives. The commission’s investigations have wrecked many a European merger. So, in order to satisfy regulators, the <small>LSE</small> has put the Borsa group, which includes <small>MTS</small>, on the block. And with the commission due to conclude its antitrust review by December 16th, <small>LSE</small> wants to agree on a sale quickly.</p><p >Euronext is the most likely victor, according to Ian White at Autonomous, a financial-research firm. Michael Werner, an analyst at <small>UBS</small>, a bank, agrees, and adds that Deutsche Börse is the least likely to win. <small>MTS</small> provides <small>LCH</small>, a clearing-house owned by <small>LSE,</small> with around €45m of revenue a year. <small>LSE</small> will therefore be keen to ensure <small>MTS</small> continues to use the clearing-house after the sale. As Euronext owns 11% of <small>LCH</small>, the odds are it would keep doing so. Deutsche Börse, by contrast, would probably divert clearing business from <small>LCH</small> to Eurex, its subsidiary. For its part, Euronext has been an active buyer of European exchanges in recent years. Mr Werner thinks it can make the most of any synergies.</p><p >Euronext’s trump card, though, is its decision to partner with the Italian state: <small>CDP</small> would own 8% of Borsa. Earlier this year Italy’s government extended its “golden-power” law, which entitles it to intervene in deals in strategically important sectors, such as financial infrastructure.</p><p >Politicians have made their intentions clear. The populist Five Star movement, which is part of the ruling coalition, wants Borsa to be brought back under Italian influence. The Northern League, a right-wing party, warns against a sale to foreigners. Consob, the financial regulator, is headed by Paolo Savona, a Eurosceptic notorious for his aversion to Germany. Binding offers are expected next month, but insiders say <small>LSE</small> could make a decision even sooner. With Rome on its side, the deal is Euronext’s to lose. <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p><p data-test-id="Footnote" >This article appeared in the Finance &amp; economics section of the print edition under the headline &quot;Shotgun wedding&quot;</p>
