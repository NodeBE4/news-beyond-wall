American regulators were spooked after some recipients of the jab developed rare but severe blood clots. Proponents hoped that by seriously addressing potentially harmful side-effects, regulators would boost confidence in vaccines. Critics worried the decision might appear to give sceptics justification for their reluctance.</p><p >New polling data confirm some fears, but dispel others. Between April 10th and 13th YouGov, a pollster, asked 1,500 Americans whether they thought the J&amp;J dose was safe and whether they have been vaccinated or plan to do so when it is their turn. Overall, 48% of respondents said they thought the J&amp;J vaccine was safe, compared with 30% who thought it was unsafe; confidence in the Pfizer and Moderna shots were 58% and 59%, respectively. YouGov also found that 59% of respondents had been or were planning to get vaccinated, compared with 23% who said they would not get a jab.</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p >Since YouGov was in the middle of conducting its survey when the government announced its recommendation to pause the J&amp;J vaccine, the pollster was able to analyse whether the news affected opinions about vaccinations. YouGov estimated that the share of people who thought the J&amp;J vaccine was safe fell by 15 percentage points as a consequence of the announcement, while the share who thought it was unsafe increased by 13 points.</p><p >Data on Americans’ overall willingness to get vaccinated, however, look more optimistic. An analysis by <em>The Economist</em> found a five-point drop in the share of adults who said they will or have been vaccinated—but this was statistically insignificant. The share saying they would not get a shot rose, but by an even smaller two points. Numbers were not significantly different for people who said they paid a lot of attention to the news. This is a welcome sign, as avid news consumers are usually leading indicators of broader trends. The share of adults who say they will not get vaccinated hit 23% last week, according to our monthly rolling average, the lowest recorded so far.</p><p >The government’s recommendation to pause the doling out of the J&amp;J vaccine has significantly undermined public confidence in this specific shot. It may also prevent a few hundred thousand additional Americans from getting vaccinated against the virus. But so far overall confidence in covid-19 vaccination seems to be unaffected.</p>
