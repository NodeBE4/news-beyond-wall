More than 2m people are known to have died from covid-19, though the true toll is probably higher still. The routines of daily life have been disrupted for billions. The end, however, is now in sight: vaccines that fight off the infection have been developed and approved in record time. On December 8th Britain became the first country to start inoculating people. Others have swiftly followed suit.</p><figure><iframe height="NaN" src="https://infographics.economist.com/2021/covid-19-vaccines-table/table-world.html" data-size="full-width"></iframe></figure><p >More than 50 countries now have active vaccination programmes, according to a tally kept by Our World in Data, a website. Collectively they have given over 50m inoculations to their residents. However, most of those countries are rich ones that were able to secure doses of the three main vaccines that have so far been approved by stringent authorities—Pfizer/BioNTech, AstraZeneca/Oxford University and Moderna. Outside western Europe and North America, inoculations are progressing at a snail&#x27;s pace. Programmes rely mostly on vaccines developed by teams in China and Russia. Fewer than 1m vaccinations have so far been given across Latin America, South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, which together account for 3.2bn of the world&#x27;s nearly 8bn people. </p><figure><iframe height="NaN" src="https://infographics.economist.com/2021/covid-19-vaccines-table/table-countries.html" data-size="full-width"></iframe></figure><p >Although Britain was the first to start its vaccination programme it does not lead the global race to herd immunity. Israel, where the first shot of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine was given to the prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, on December 19th, has now administered a first dose to more than a quarter of its population. Second doses are following after 21 days—in contrast to Britain&#x27;s strategy of giving as many people as possible a first dose before providing a second within 12 weeks. </p><p >Given the still nascent nature of these programmes, there is still some way to go until normal life, or something resembling it, is restored. Despite all the optimism, the task of rolling out billions of vaccine shots around the world will not be easy. Furthermore, scientists are yet to establish how long immunity lasts, and whether vaccines merely prevent symptoms from developing or whether they stop transmission, too. What is clear is that covid-19 will remain endemic—much like the winter flu—for some time.</p><figure><iframe height="NaN" src="https://infographics.economist.com/2020/covid-19-world-tracker/time-series-region.html" data-size="full-width"></iframe></figure><p >As the map and chart above show, covid-19 is now most active in Europe and North America. On January 12th the United States recorded 4,459 deaths—the most yet in a single day. Countries across western Europe have introduced new national lockdowns in an effort to curb infections, particularly after a more infectious strain of covid-19 was discovered in Britain. The rapid rise in infections in western Europe has led to deaths soaring ever higher. They reached a new high of 6,970 on January 19th, 23% of them in Britain. </p><figure><iframe height="NaN" src="https://infographics.economist.com/2020/covid-19-world-tracker/hemispheres.html" data-size="full-width"></iframe></figure><p >Scientists dispute the effect that weather might have on the <small>SARS-CoV-2</small> virus. But after suppressing the virus for much of its summer, the northern hemisphere is experiencing the worst of the pandemic as winter sets in. Deaths caused by covid-19 in countries whose geographic centre is north of the equator have risen from under 4,000 a day in October to an average of 10,000 in December and January. In the southern hemisphere deaths from covid-19 remained below 2,000 a day between October and January, but they are now rising once again. </p><p >Our map below presents the &quot;centre of gravity&quot; of the epidemic as determined by the average latitude and longitude of countries, weighted by their official death toll each week. This indicator shows that after breaking out of China, the centre of the epidemic shifted westwards rapidly, and has oscillated around the north Atlantic since September. </p><figure><iframe height="NaN" src="https://infographics.economist.com/2020/covid-19-world-tracker/centre-of-gravity.html" data-size="full-width"></iframe></figure><p >It is likely that the epidemic’s centre of gravity will move once again. First, spring weather in March may reduce the number of infections in the northern hemisphere, but may well increase them in the southern hemisphere. Second, because vaccines are being administered in rich Western countries first—as they have had the greatest financial means to acquire and deliver them—covid-19 may remain most active in poorer countries, especially those with elderly populations. Our visualisations, which use data from Johns Hopkins University and other sources, will continue to track covid-19 as it moves around the world.</p><figure><iframe height="NaN" src="https://infographics.economist.com/2020/covid-19-world-tracker/table.html" data-size="full-width"></iframe></figure><p data-interactive- >Sources: Johns Hopkins University CSSE; Our World In Data; UN; <i>The Economist</i></p><figure data-infographic-js="1"></figure>
