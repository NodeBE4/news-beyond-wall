The term may also come to describe the progression of the pandemic in Europe. The pan-continental drive to vaccinate the EU’s 450m citizens has started at a glacial pace. Given more than 100,000 daily cases of late—and more deaths than in America—a laggardly inoculation schedule risks extending covid’s grip on Europe for several months.</p><p >Mainland Europe stands out as a global vaccine straggler, certainly in the rich world. America and Britain have already jabbed 1-2% of their populations; Israel, the world’s stand-out star, is now at 16%, according to Our World in Data, a website. In contrast Germany has administered merely 317,000 jabs, or 0.4% of its people. France did not break the 1,000 mark until January 4th. The Netherlands is due to start its vaccination drive only this week.</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p >The delay has become a political time-bomb in just about every EU member as lockdowns are tightened (Germany has extended its restrictions by three weeks). Health professionals are blaming politicians, politicians are blaming each other, and everyone is wondering whether the European Commission, the EU’s executive arm in Brussels, which co-ordinated the procurement of vaccines, has been up to snuff. Britain, which left the bloc last year and only recently concluded a narrow trade deal, may also be under renewed lockdown; but its more nimble action on vaccinations adds to the sense that something is amiss. Tensions will keep rising in the coming weeks, especially if Europeans see others closer to a return to normal life as they see no prospect of an end to life under lockdown.</p><p >Nothing presaged that Europe should become a vaccine dawdler. Across the continent, health systems are well funded. The continent is brimming with researchers—BioNTech, which with Pfizer developed the first fully vetted vaccine to come to market, is a German firm—and manufacturing facilities. In contrast to poor countries, even pricey jabs can be justified by the pandemic’s economic toll.</p><p >Three factors explain Europe’s slow start. The first is that vaccine approvals there took longer. The European Medicines Agency—the EU body in charge of approving drugs for the whole bloc, which as a result of Brexit moved from London to Amsterdam in 2019—has lagged behind its American and British counterparts by several weeks. The EU’s approval for the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine came through on December 22nd, three weeks after Britain’s and ten days after America’s. On January 6th the EMA is expected to sign off on another vaccine, by Moderna, which American regulators accepted in mid-December. The AstraZeneca-Oxford jab that is simpler to administer and Britain has started using is not expected to be available in Europe until next month. Officials say that although the type of authorisation the EU has insisted on takes more time, the additional scrutiny is worth the wait.</p><p >A second reason for the delay concerns procurement. EU countries decided early on to shop collectively for vaccines, using the heft of the bloc to secure better terms. The strategy seems to have succeeded in driving down prices. Perhaps as a result, or just by virtue of having failed to back the right horse, Europeans ordered comparatively less of the expensive BioNTech vaccine, which is for now the only one approved in the EU. The commission has stressed that it purchased plenty of vaccines: around 2bn doses, or enough to inoculate the EU’s entire population several times over. But Americans and Brits went further overboard, and are now reaping the rewards of having eschewed penny-pinching. Europe will have to wait for the AstraZeneca-Oxford jab before it can really vaccinate large numbers.</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p >The final reason for low vaccination rates has to do with the logistics of getting vaccines into arms. Here, national governments (or even regional ones) are in full control. Roll-outs designed in the autumn of 2020, when the pandemic appeared to be in abeyance, seem unambitious now that it has endured. Worse, new, faster-spreading variants of the virus have emerged, making the task seem even more urgent.</p><p >National governments have had to put up with the quirks of their health systems—and their electorates. France, for example, has had to tailor its strategy to the fact that just 40% of its population said they would submit to vaccination. (Its plan involves taking advice from 35 people randomly selected from the general public.) The considered approach it plumped for to ensure care-home residents gave informed consent, for example, involves repeated medical visits. In Italy, second only to Germany in total inoculations, and Spain some regions are doing well while others dawdle.</p><p >Numbers may improve as the sense of urgency increases. President Emmanuel Macron has berated French ministers and health authorities, repudiating their public calls for patience as vaccination programmes are ramped up, with more than 5,000 inoculations on January 5th. Jens Spahn, Germany’s health minister, has put pressure on the European machine to pick up the pace. Like Britain, Germany is now considering delaying applications of the second dose of the vaccine in order to give more people a first jab. A fresh order of the Pfizer-BioNTech serum is in the works.</p><p >Officials across the EU seem to be pointing to April as the real test of the bloc’s vaccination strategy. By then, production of three different jabs will be in full swing, and logistical teething problems will have been ironed out. A few weeks may not seem long, when the pandemic will by then have raged for a year. To those who feel government bungling has extended their time waiting at home, it may feel like an eternity.</p>
