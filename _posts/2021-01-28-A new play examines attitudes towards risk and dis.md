Conveying the passion of scientific discovery is a goal she shares with her husband, Nathan Wolfe, an expert in viruses, whom she first interviewed for research a decade ago. He is now the subject of her latest work, a solo 70-minute drama called “The Catastrophist”, commissioned by the Marin Theatre Company in San Francisco (where Ms Gunderson is the playwright-in-residence) and the Round House Theatre in Maryland. It explores scientific ideas—viruses and epidemics, risk analysis and planetary life—and examines humans’ short-sightedness when it comes to preparing for disasters. </p><p >The play begins with Nathan (William DeMeritt, in a mesmerising performance) in 2016, aged 40, disoriented and alone, unsure of his exact location. Gradually he realises that he is in a play written by his wife. The audience is equally unsure where this is all leading, but what follows is a subtle blend of film and live theatre, with the playwright hovering somewhere out of view. (The play is being filmed and streamed via the Marin Theatre website.) Nathan agrees to follow her instructions and describe his life. The work begins under the title of “The Virologist” but life, in the shape of calamities professional and personal, intervenes, shocking the play into a new register and title.</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p >If it’s a risk being married to a playwright, as Nathan quips, it’s also daunting to write about a spouse. Writing this was a “risk to our friendship as a married couple, an artistic risk, a personal risk”, Ms Gunderson says. Fortunately, her material was rich: her husband’s life is interesting and exotic yet entirely normal, filled, like all lives, with discovery and disappointment, joy and loss. The audience is treated to fascinating disquisitions, on subjects from his research in Cameroon to meetings at the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, and his fruitless efforts to awaken humanity to the need to prepare for a global pandemic. The audience learns about zoonotic diseases (pathogens that jump from animals to humans); how alien viruses are from the rest of planetary life; how to actually measure risk. Ambitious, driven, slightly cocky, the scientist brags: “Give me a catastrophe, and I will give you a plan.” But in the end, even a world-famous virologist is not immune from the blindness to impending disaster that affects everyone.</p><p >Early in the play, Nathan describes his fear as a child that his grievously ill father will die. “The world is exposed as the delicate thing it really is,” he recalls. It is a line that resonates quietly throughout the play, as does the coronavirus pandemic itself. Though it was written in lockdown, “The Catastrophist” is not about the current crisis, a fact that pleases the real Dr Wolfe, who notes that most of humanity now suffers from “pandemic fatigue”. </p><p >Yet it is inescapably about it, too. In a riff on pandemic insurance, the scientist muses about “how to create resilience in case a pandemic shuts down half of the world’s economy….it could happen.” His warnings are prophetic, though he does not know all that the audience knows. This sense of doubleness enriches the play, lending its themes gravity and weight. For as the story unfolds, it transpires that on a human scale as well as a planetary one, disasters that are foreseeable can nonetheless rear up to catch societies unawares. Prospero will not give away the play’s cunning twist, but Nathan is forced to admit: “I am good at thinking about what comes next. But I did not see that coming.”</p><p >The tale could easily have drifted into a Cassandra mode of “I told you so.” But in Ms Gunderson’s hands, it sheds compassionate light on the all-too-human tendency to ignore catastrophe until it is too late. “We could all be catastrophists if we would start to understand what actually kills us,” Nathan proclaims. That understanding would involve assigning risk to real things and acting accordingly by using measurements called micromorts, for example, one of which equals the one in a million chance of dying from a given act. Riding a motorcycle, skydiving, using heroin come in at 10, 8 and 30 micromorts respectively—while giving birth, for an American woman, is the equivalent of 210 micromorts. “This is what science is!” Nathan tells the audience repeatedly. Dr Wolfe adds: “Understanding relative risk is hugely freeing.” There’s no risk, and plenty of reward, in watching this essential lesson.</p><p ><em>“The Catastrophist” is streaming until February 28th. Tickets are $30 at marintheatre.org</em></p><br><hr><div>获取更多RSS：<br><a href="https://feedx.net" style="color:orange" target="_blank">https://feedx.net</a> <br><a href="https://feedx.xyz" style="color:orange" target="_blank">https://feedx.xyz</a><br></div>
