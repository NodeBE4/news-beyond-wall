The latest oddity is the growing chorus of complaints in America about a shortage of labour, even as unemployment remains high, with 8m fewer people in work today than before covid-19 struck. Earlier this month Bloomberg reported that Delta Air Lines had cancelled 100 flights for lack of workers. One café in Florida has turned to robots to greet customers and deliver food, people are so hard to find. A branch of McDonald’s is paying potential burger-flippers $50 just to turn up for a job interview. </p><div ><figure><div itemscope="" itemProp="image" itemType="https://schema.org/ImageObject" data-slim="1"><meta itemProp="url" content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/662/90/sites/default/files/20210501_FNC045.png"/><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/662/90/sites/default/files/20210501_FNC045.png"  sizes="300px" alt=""/></div></figure><p >The data back up the anecdotes. At the end of last year, 22% of manufacturing firms were operating below capacity because of a lack of workers, up from 16% the year before, according to analysis of a survey by the Federal Reserve. Total vacancies are running at their highest level for at least two decades (see chart), indicating that firms have plenty of unfilled positions. Furthermore, job openings are leading to fewer hires than you would expect based on the historical relationship. And even accounting for changes in the composition of the workforce, wage growth, at about 3%, has been surprisingly robust, suggesting that firms are offering bigger pay packets to tempt workers. If they persist job shortages could eventually fuel inflation, threatening the economic recovery. </p><p >There are three potential explanations for the puzzle: overly generous benefits; fearful workers; and a reallocation of labour between industries. Start with America’s huge fiscal handouts. The latest cheques, posted in the spring, were for up to $1,400 per person. Every American knows of a neighbour’s cousin’s boyfriend who received a stimmy cheque then quit his job in order to sit on the sofa. A federal supplement to unemployment insurance (UI), currently $300 a week, ensures that four in ten unemployed people earn more from benefits than they did in their previous job. Economic research has long concluded that more generous welfare payments blunt incentives to look for work. </p><p >Yet this relationship appears to have weakened during the pandemic. The fact that increases in UI payments have been time-limited may make workers reluctant to turn down a job with longer-lasting rewards. In the early part of the pandemic the UI supplement was even more generous, at $600, but its expiration in the summer had “little effect on overall employment”, according to a paper published in February by Arindrajit Dube of the University of Massachusetts-Amherst. Likewise areas where the current $300 represents a relatively larger boost to income have not seen weaker employment growth since January, when that uplift was introduced. </p><p >That suggests the second factor, fear, might be important in explaining America’s shortage of staff. Nearly 4m people are not looking for work “because of the coronavirus pandemic”, according to official data. And consider which industries are experiencing the most acute worker shortages. Jobs in health care, recreation and hospitality report the highest level of job openings, relative to employment. Many of these involve plenty of person-to-person contact, making their workers especially vulnerable to infection (a study from California earlier this year found that cooks were most at risk from dying of covid-19). By contrast, in industries where maintaining social distancing or being outside is often easier, labour shortages are less of an issue. The number of job openings per employee in the construction industry is lower today than it was before the pandemic. </p></div><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p >The final reason for worker shortages relates to the extraordinary reallocation of resources under way in the world’s largest economy. The headline growth in vacancies represents the rise in opportunities in some industries—say, clerks in DIY stores—as other sorts decline, reflecting changing consumer demands. Analysis by <em>The Economist</em> of over 400 local areas also finds a wide variation in job churn across geographies: the gap between jobs growth in the most buoyant areas and that in struggling ones is twice as wide as it was before the pandemic. Workers may take time to catch up with this creative destruction. A former bartender looking for work in downtown Manhattan, for instance, may not immediately spot and secure a position as a delivery driver in farther-out Westchester.</p><p >As vaccinations continue to reduce hospitalisations and deaths from covid-19, and limit the spread of the disease, Americans’ fears about taking high-contact jobs should fade too. But if shortages are to fully dissipate, and the threat of inflation is to be contained, some of the unemployed will also have to take up work in sectors and areas that are new to them. </p>
