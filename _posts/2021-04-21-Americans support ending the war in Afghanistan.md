Some say the move will further destabilise the country; others insist it is time for America’s 20-year campaign to end. Among the public, however, there is considerably more consensus. In a poll conducted by YouGov for <em>The Economist</em> between April 17th and April 20th, Americans backed Mr Biden’s decision by more than two to one. Some 58% of adults said they approved of the decision to draw down the remaining 2,500 troops in Afghanistan later this year, compared with just 25% who said they disapproved (see chart).</p><p >Americans long ago soured on the war effort, not least because of its enormous cost in blood and treasure. According to the Department of Defence, nearly 23,000 Americans have been killed or wounded in Afghanistan since 2001. In that time, America has spent nearly $1trn on the conflict. Though American intelligence officials believe terrorist groups do not currently threaten to strike America from Afghanistan, the country is far from stable, and many believe the war’s costs have exceeded its benefits. According to YouGov, 36% of Americans think the war was a mistake, with a roughly equal share saying they think it was not.</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p >They seem equally ambivalent about broader counter-terrorism efforts. Only 39% of respondents in this week’s poll said the “global war on terror”, launched in the aftermath of the attacks on September 11th 2001, was worth the cost, while 35% said it wasn’t. Young people were not any more likely than the elderly to think the cost of the war was justified.</p><p >“It&#x27;s time to end America’s longest war,” Mr Biden said when announcing the withdrawal on April 14th. “We cannot continue the cycle of extending or expanding our military presence in Afghanistan, hoping to create ideal conditions for the withdrawal, and expecting a different result.” YouGov’s polling suggests the people agree.</p>
