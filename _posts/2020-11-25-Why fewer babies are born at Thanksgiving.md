Last year a record 26m people flew across the country for the holiday; this year many fewer are expected to make similar trips. But one destination is always quiet at Thanksgiving, and during other public holidays too: the delivery room. The number of births is 18% lower during public holidays than the rest of the year, according to a new <a href="https://www.economist.comhttps://www.nber.org/papers/w27326">working paper</a>. This is in part because of patients’ preferences, but financial incentives also play a role.</p><p >To understand the relationship between holidays and births, researchers at the University of Southern California and the University of California, Santa Barbara, analysed records of nearly 9m births in the state between 2000 and 2016. As well as having a diverse ethnic and racial mix, California accounts for more than 12% of America’s annual births. The researchers looked at three delivery types: Caesarean section; induced labour (where contractions are stimulated); and spontaneous vaginal birth. On an average day 1,447 babies were delivered. But over a public holiday and the day after, there were typically 512 fewer births. The biggest shortfall came on Christmas Day, followed by New Year’s Day, Memorial Day and Thanksgiving.</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p >Caesarean sections, which make up almost half of the decline, were lower by around 25%. Induced births were down by 20%, and spontaneous births by only 10% (see chart). The missing births instead took place either side of the holiday; three-quarters of the deficit is made up within a week. The preferences of expectant mothers go some way to explain the decline. Holidays are already frantic, and they may choose to give birth at a quieter time. (The authors also note that some parents do not want their children to be born on inauspicious dates, such as Friday 13th, although that effect is smaller than the holiday reduction.)</p><p >The authors attribute a greater share of responsibility for the rescheduled births to hospitals, however. The biggest drop was for Caesarean sections because they are the easiest to move to another day. Hospitals want to allow staff to take holidays off, and to avoid paying overtime. Babies due during holidays might also be delivered early, by elective Caesarean section or by induction, hence the holiday-season decline in spontaneous births. Economic factors may be at play, too, the authors suggest. Caesarean sections and induced births are more resource-intensive, so hospitals can charge higher fees to perform them. The authors found that more spontaneous births occurred during holidays in hospitals that do not demand a fixed amount per service (for example, those owned by Kaiser Permanente, a not-for-profit health-care company).</p><p >Postponing births, even high-risk ones, seems to have little negative impact on the health of newborns and their mothers. But if not planned carefully, a big shift in birthdays might put undue pressure on hospital staff, many of whom are already struggling to cope with covid-19. Even so, America’s midwives can look forward to a quiet Thanksgiving.</p>
