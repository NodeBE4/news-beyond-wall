Although it’s anyone’s guess whom he will select, political bettors place the shortest odds on Kamala Harris, a senator and prosecutor from California, and Susan Rice, who was Barack Obama’s ambassador to the United Nations and national security adviser.</p><p >Presidential candidates pondering a running-mate face a dilemma: should they pick a partner who can bring extra voters into the fold, carrying their home state over the line? Or should they choose the person who will do the best job as vice-president? And because of Mr Biden’s old age, there is also a reasonable chance that whomever he picks will take over the duties of the presidency.</p><div  id="gpt-ad-slot-1" data-test-id="Inline Ad"></div><p >An analysis of past presidential elections by <em>The Economist</em> reveals that vice-presidential choices have only a subtle impact on the race. We built a statistical model to predict state-level results for each presidential election from 1976 to 2016 using a measure of each state’s recent partisan history and how the nation voted. We find that adding an indicator for each vice-presidential candidate’s home state only mildly increases the predictiveness of our model.</p><p >On average, Democratic candidates do about one-and-a-half percentage points better in the state from which their running-mate hails (ie, the blue dots in the chart are on average one-and-a-half points above the line marking perfect accuracy). Republican candidates, meanwhile, do about one-and-a-half percentage points better in the home states of their VP picks (the red dots). However, we can’t be sure which way the arrow of causality points: whether the Democrats’ improved chances are directly caused by the vice-presidential selection; or are an artificial product of picking candidates from bluer-than-average states.</p><p >Although Mr Biden’s selection could tip a competitive state—such as Georgia, Arizona or Texas—it is unlikely to change the outcome of the entire election, especially if he picks a nominee, such as Ms Harris, from a navy-blue state. Much more important will be how Washington and the media characterise his choice. A former prosecutor (like Ms Harris) or Obama-administration official (Ms Rice) could give Donald Trump and the conservative commentariat something to get their teeth into.</p><p ><strong>Dig deeper:</strong><br/><em>Sign up and listen to Checks and Balance, our <a href="https://www.economist.com/checksandbalance/">weekly newsletter</a> and <a href="https://www.economist.com/podcasts/2020/08/01/checks-and-balance-our-weekly-podcast-on-american-politics" data-tegid="i0uplk8vm85dnd1gaeurpcoqijmjc7hg">podcast</a> on American politics, and explore our <a href="https://www.economist.comhttps://projects.economist.com/us-2020-forecast/president">presidential election forecast</a></em></p>
