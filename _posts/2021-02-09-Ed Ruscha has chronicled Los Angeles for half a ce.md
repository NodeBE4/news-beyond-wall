The camera was equipped with a motorised lens which allowed him to control the focus and zoom remotely. A year later he assembled the photos into “Every Building on the Sunset Strip”, a thin accordion-fold book. It was a new kind of “artist book” in America, commercially produced and costing a few dollars, and it thumbed its nose at the traditional deluxe <em>livre d’artiste</em> made in Europe.</p><p >One copy of this 27-foot-long pleated strip is now stretched out to its full glory at the Legion of Honor, part of the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco. With the museum still closed, only the occasional cleaner and curator can peruse the photos’ odd succession of stucco storefronts, garish signage, telephone wires and ubiquitous cars. Luckily, 610 kilometres to the south, at the Getty Centre high above Los Angeles, the curators of Mr Ruscha’s enormous photo archive have now unfurled these images for viewers worldwide.</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p >“12 Sunsets”, an interactive website, presents the images from the initial photobook of 1967 as well as pictures of the same stretch of Sunset Boulevard shot by Mr Ruscha over 12 different years. The online portal puts 65,982 photos at the viewer’s fingertips, dating from 1965 to 2007. Like legions of teenagers before them, visitors can hop in a set of (virtual) wheels and drive east or west, taking in the sights to either side. Choose more than one year, and the viewer travels simultaneously at different times, the garish colours of the 21st century contrasting with the low-slung black-and-white autos of yesteryear.</p><figure><div itemscope="" itemProp="image" itemType="https://schema.org/ImageObject" data-slim="0"><meta itemProp="url" content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/720/90/sites/default/files/images/2021/02/blogs/prospero/20210213_bkp505_1.jpg"/><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/720/90/sites/default/files/images/2021/02/blogs/prospero/20210213_bkp505_1.jpg"  sizes="(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw" alt=""/></div></figure><p >At first glance, the images can be baffling: the parade of nondescript buildings and mid-century signage is mundane. If you dwell longer, however, clicking to enlarge individual frames, an urban poetry starts to emerge. Here is the quintessential Los Angeles landscape, a city built for the car: Hollywood’s true, unglamorous underside. Landscapes, built and unbuilt, were to prove Mr Ruscha’s enduring artistic preoccupation. From his earliest photos, paintings and lithographs—often of words or phrases superimposed on an empty horizon—his art reflects the wide-open, yet furiously developing, West. </p><p >From the minute he arrived in Los Angeles from Oklahoma as an art student aged 18, Mr Ruscha wanted to be “showing the land”. In the late 1950s newcomers flooded into the city at the rate of 1,000 people a day. “It was all so attractive to me, the vegetation, the sunsets, the lifestyle,” he said. Driving back and forth to Oklahoma on Route 66, he began to look at America in the same “raw, unfiltered” way as Jack Kerouac had in his novel “On the Road”, published in 1957. Mr Ruscha would also document what he saw from the road. He produced a series of photobooks: first “Twentysix Gasoline Stations” (one early critic sneered that this was “doomed to oblivion”, but copies are now worth over $15,000), then “Real Estate Opportunities”, “Thirtyfour Parking Lots” and others on swimming pools and views from rooftops.</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p >It was while working as a graphic artist that the Sunset Strip, once a haunt of old Hollywood and then emerging as an epicentre of rock and roll, occurred to him as an interesting subject. Attending a concert by the rock band The Doors at the infamous Whisky A Go-Go nightclub, Mr Ruscha was captivated by the cacophony of typographic signs and shapes on the crowded strip of bars and clubs. “It just had a wavy, windy sort of look to it that I like,” he told an interviewer at the time. “And I just said, ‘Well, I’ll start here.” Over the next half-century, Mr Ruscha would become the definitive artist of the sprawling, car-centred blur of pavement and low-rise buildings that is LA.</p><figure><div itemscope="" itemProp="image" itemType="https://schema.org/ImageObject" data-slim="0"><meta itemProp="url" content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/720/90/sites/default/files/images/2021/02/blogs/prospero/20210213_bkp504_1.jpg"/><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/720/90/sites/default/files/images/2021/02/blogs/prospero/20210213_bkp504_1.jpg"  sizes="(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw" alt=""/></div></figure><p >The artist donated more than half a million images and street sketches to the Getty Research Institute in 2012, creating the “Ed Ruscha Streets of Los Angeles Archive”, from which the photos in the online exhibition are drawn. Andrew Perchuk, deputy director of the institute, considers the archive “the most significant artistic record of a city in the United States and perhaps the world.” So choose a set of wheels—a VW van or a Beetle or a maroon pickup, based on Mr Ruscha’s own Datsun—and hop in, passing the Roxy, Chateau Marmont and the Whisky A Go-Go and perhaps going all the way west to the Pacific Ocean. To Mr Ruscha, Los Angeles is like a studio set or the Hollywood sign: a flat plane propped up from behind. “That’s what intrigues me about the whole city of Los Angeles,” he has said: “the facade-ness of the whole thing.”</p><p ><em>“12 Sunsets: Exploring Ed Ruscha’s Archive” is available to view at <a href="https://www.economist.comhttps://12sunsets.getty.edu/map/1985?d=0.42256">12Sunsets.Getty.edu </a></em></p><p ><strong>Picture credits:</strong> From Sunset Blvd, 1966, Ed Ruscha. <br/>Cineramadome on Sunset Boulevard photographed by Ed Ruscha in 2007.<br/>Danny Kwan, Ed Ruscha and Bryan Heath with Ruscha’s Datsun pick-up, 1975.<br/>Streets of Los Angeles Archive.
