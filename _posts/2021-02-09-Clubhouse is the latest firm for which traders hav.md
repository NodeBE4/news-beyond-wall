The social network, which was launched in March 2020, creates audio chatrooms in which users can listen to live conferences—but only if they have been invited to join the platform by existing members. By January this exclusive audience had grown to at least 2m active users, including Oprah Winfrey, Drake and Elon Musk. The app soon took off in China, where members used it to discuss the government’s detention of Uyghurs and aggression towards Taiwan. Not for long. On February 9th, it was blocked by China’s “Great Firewall”.</p><p >Lots of people want equity in Silicon Valley’s latest fad. After Mr Musk tweeted that he was joining the platform on January 31st, the share price of Clubhouse Media Group soared by 117%. Unfortunately, trigger-happy traders had failed to spot that ownership of the Clubhouse app, like membership, is by invitation only. The social network is not publicly listed. It was reportedly valued at $1bn recently when it raised $100m from private investors. Clubhouse Media Group is a wholly separate firm, based in China, which trades under the ticker “CMGR”. Once its new shareholders spotted their mistake, its price tumbled back down.</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p >Mr Musk’s tweets have led to such snafus before. On January 7th he instructed his 46m Twitter followers to “use Signal”, an encrypted messaging app. Investors promptly bought shares in Signal Advance, a medical-device company from Texas with one full-time employee. At the peak of the frenzy its share price rose more than six-fold before falling back.</p><p >Confusion over stock names is not new. In the late 1990s investors eager for shares in MCI, an American telecoms firm, accidentally bought MassMutual Corporate Investors, a closed-end fund with the ticker “MCI”. In 2013 traders intending to purchase shares in Twitter instead bid on Tweeter Home Entertainment, a bankrupt consumer-electronics firm—a month before the social-media platform went public. In 2017 they confused Snap, the parent company of Snapchat, a messaging app, with Snap Interactive, a software company.</p><p >Last year some investors even mixed up Tesla, the electric-car maker run by Mr Musk, with Tiziana Life Sciences, a biotech firm with the ticker “TLSA”. And a covid-induced surge in users for Zoom, a video-conferencing service, coincided with a spike in investment for Zoom Technologies, a small Beijing-based holding company that traded under the ticker “ZOOM”.</p><p >These apparently trivial errors can be costly. In a <a href="https://www.economist.comhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1386418118303094">paper</a> published in 2019 Vadim Balashov and Andrei Nikiforov of Rutgers University analysed American stockmarket data from 1993 to 2013. They studied 31 cases in which investors probably mixed up a pair of companies. In these instances, about 5% of the annual trading volume of the smaller firm in each pair—such as Zoom Technologies and Signal Advance—could be attributed to confusion. Overall, the authors reckon that investors frittered away about $66m on transaction costs for these muddled purchases. They did not calculate the costs to careless traders of buying the wrong shares at too high a price—or put a value on their embarrassment.</p>
