They are 78,000 years old, making them the most ancient human burial yet unearthed in Africa. The lefthand group of bones are the child’s spine and thorax; those to the right, the skull and some vertebrae. They were excavated and analysed by a team lead by researchers from the National Museums of Kenya and the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History, in Jena, Germany, who published their findings in this week’s <em>Nature</em>. Mtoto, whose sex cannot be determined but whose name means “child” in Swahili, was about three years old. That the burial was deliberate seems clear. The skeleton was in a circular pit and the child is thought, from the way the bones were arranged, to have been laid out with its head on a pillow.</p>
