Exasperated cabin crew battling to close overhead lockers full to bursting with wheelie-bags, duty-free booze and laptop cases have been replaced by masked attendants presiding over planes two-thirds full at best and often with only a handful of passengers. Some report sleeping across empty rows of seats. The collapse of passenger numbers and revenues will damage the industry. Yet previous disruptions have shaken up the airlines to the benefit of the flying public. It could happen again.</p><p >The advantages of the previous big interruption to air travel, the second world war, are debatable. The experience of servicemen crammed into uncomfortably spartan transport aircraft, argues Eric Zuelow in his book, “A History of Modern Tourism”, created a generation without pre-war expectations of air travel as glamorous and luxurious. When those same aircraft were converted for civilian use, travellers accepted being packed in like sardines. The cattle-truck economics worked in passengers’ favour when deregulation brought competition to a previously highly regulated and often state-controlled industry. Air fares tumbled everywhere. Between 1995 and 2014 they fell by half in real terms, according to <small>IATA,</small> a club of the world’s airlines.</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p >World wars aside, past crises have passed speedily. The terrorist attacks of 9/11 and the financial crisis of 2009 were “nasty shocks”, says Brian Pearce, chief economist of <small>IATA</small>, but “small bumps in the road” compared with covid-19. At its height in April 2020 flying was down by 94% over a year earlier, measured by total revenue passenger kilometres (<small>RPK</small>s). Current estimates are that <small>RPK</small>s in 2020 will be down by 66% on 2019, when (including domestic flights) 4.5bn passengers took to the skies. Only 1.8bn people buckled up last year. By the end of it, some 30% of the global fleet was still grounded, according to Cirium, an aviation-data firm. And the sense of optimism that had slowly grown took a fresh hit early in 2021 as more transmissible and dangerous variants of the virus emerged, leading to renewed border closures and capacity cuts.</p><p >The plunge comes after years of bumper growth. In each 15-year period since 1988 <small>RPKS</small> doubled. They were expected to do so again between 2018 and 2033, according to Airbus, the European half of the duopoly that builds the world’s biggest passenger jets. Boeing, its American rival, notes an acceleration over the past decade, when growth averaged 6.5% per year, above the long-term average of 5%. Darren Hulst of Boeing is confident of an eventual return to a growth trend of 5% a year, even if over the decade from 2019 the number may be closer to 3.7%. In the meantime it will be a rough ride for airlines. Only 2.8bn passengers are expected to take to the air this year.</p><div ><figure><div itemscope="" itemProp="image" itemType="https://schema.org/ImageObject" data-slim="1"><meta itemProp="url" content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/670/90/sites/default/files/images/print-edition/20210213_SRC406.png"/><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/670/90/sites/default/files/images/print-edition/20210213_SRC406.png"  sizes="300px" alt=""/></div></figure><p >Signs of recovery are scant. Domestic flying in China and Russia has largely recovered, but in Australia it is still down by 86% and in America, the world’s biggest domestic market, it has fallen by 60%. International routes are suffering the most. Despite huge capacity cuts (only a quarter of the international flights scheduled a year earlier were still running in January), load factors are still low. Planes are often taking off a third full at most.</p><p >The opportunity for travellers to stretch out comes at a heavy cost. Full service will not resume for a long while. Mr Pearce says the gradual deployment of vaccines merely makes him more confident about his baseline forecast of a return to 2019 levels by 2024. Not all air travel will recover at the same pace. Domestic flying will continue its rebound, followed by regional international traffic. The last part of the industry to refill its seats will be long-haul flying. This has a disproportionate impact on legacy airlines that still rely most on long-haul international routes.</p><p >All airlines face a bleak period. Rather than increase by 4% on 2019 levels to $872bn, air-transport revenues in 2020 have plummeted to $340bn, reckons <small>IATA</small>. In a good year the industry makes an operating profit of $50bn. Losses for 2020 are forecast at $118bn and, even if the second half of this year sees a recovery, they will still be around $38bn in 2021.</p><p >Airlines have responded by slashing costs, getting rid of staff and cutting fleets, yet carriers continue to burn cash at a rate of $5bn-6bn a month. Looking at the cash and liquid assets of carriers in mid-2020, the median airline had enough funding to last just eight-and-a-half months (or half way through this month), according to <small>IATA</small>. Some big names have succumbed. Norwegian Air Shuttle, one of Europe’s largest low-cost carriers, sought bankruptcy protection in November 2020. Dozens of smaller airlines including FlyBe, a British low-cost carrier, Virgin Australia and Avianca, based in Latin America, have gone to the wall.</p></div><p >Two types of carrier have the best chance of survival. Those with sound business models and strong balance-sheets, such as Ryanair in Europe, Southwest in America and AirAsia, are all low-cost carriers ready for a rebound. And legacy carriers, mostly propped up by governments, will keep their grip on long-haul flying when it returns.</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-2"></div></div></div><h2>Subsidies, subsidies</h2><p >Support for airlines has been prodigious. Governments are used to helping airlines for reasons of national pride and to maintain international connections. Many countries in the Middle East, India and Africa cling to ownership of loss-making national carriers. Others are just returning to the orbit of governments. Bruno Le Maire, France’s finance minister, has promised to “do what is necessary to guarantee the survival of Air France”. Germany’s Lufthansa has had a bumper aid package. America’s airlines, never shy to extend an upturned palm, benefited handsomely from its <small>CARES</small> stimulus act, signed into law in March 2020, which set aside $25bn in grants for airlines and the same in loans and guarantees.</p><p >The result will be an industry wallowing in debt and beholden once again to the state. Aviation Strategy, a consultancy, puts the total in 2020 of government support plus loans from banks, other investors and aircraft-leasing companies at $600bn, an increase of $170bn since the end of 2019. Keith McMullen, a partner at the consultancy, points out that most government aid has come in the form of loans, the terms of which incentivise rapid repayment. But the fragile state of the industry will make that tricky. European governments may then be obliged to swap debt for equity.</p><p >A return to the days before deregulation and the rise of low-cost carriers, when governments controlled national flag-carriers, set (high) fares and decided routes based on national goals rather than demand, is the fear of Andrew Charlton of Aviation Advocacy, another consultancy. America’s big carriers, Asian giants such as Singapore Airlines, and Lufthansa and Air France-<small>KLM</small> may be subject to government meddling. The terms of bail-outs for Air France stipulate that it must no longer compete with high-speed rail on some routes; Lufthansa’s decide what planes it may purchase.</p><p >That could give the low-cost carriers an advantage. Michael O’Leary, boss of Ryanair, admits to mixed feelings about state aid. Although it is “hugely distorting”, it is also likely to “sustain high-cost employment”, he says. And high-cost competitors are what he and his kind thrive on. Legacy airlines, already having to compete harder on short-haul routes and often weighed down by heavy pension-fund deficits, could struggle to adapt to an uncertain future that will require flexibility and nimbleness as well as lower costs.</p><p >Moreover, legacy carriers rely especially heavily on lucrative business travellers, a sector that may never recover fully, to subsidise seats at the back of the plane. If business customers and feeder routes dwindle, the complex web of domestic and international flights becomes harder to sustain, reducing connections and forcing up long-haul prices.</p><p >Not all will suffer. British Airways has slashed costs and raised capital and is fast-tracking its previous restructuring effort to compete with low-cost rivals. Other models look riskier. The Gulf carriers—Emirates, Etihad and Qatar Airways—that have grown swiftly in recent years may struggle. They lack a large domestic market to fall back on, unlike their Chinese competitors, and passengers may prefer not to mix with people from all over the world as they change planes at vast airports in the Gulf. If their model falters, the sky will be clearer for China’s state-controlled behemoths, which are already eating away at long-haul routes.</p><p >Low-cost carriers such as Ryanair and Wizz Air, based in eastern Europe, sniff opportunities. Mr O’Leary has promised to slash fares to rekindle his business. His ability to compete with airlines under the heavy hand of the state will be helped by several factors. The availability of bargains from embattled planemakers and leasing companies will help carriers in decent health or with new business models. Ryanair confirmed an order for another 75 Boeing 737<small>MAXS</small> in December, taking its total to 210. The plane’s grounding after two fatal crashes had led to cancelled orders, so a big vote of confidence from Ryanair was surely worth a hefty discount. Wizz Air, which relies on more robust parts of the market such as younger flyers and east Europeans going west for work and returning to visit family, also has big growth plans. Southwest, America’s biggest low-cost carrier, is in expansion mode as the country’s legacy carriers retreat. Tony Fernandes, boss of Air Asia, based in Malaysia, is “quietly optimistic” about 2021, and hopes to start three new airlines in the region.</p><p >A surplus of pilots where there was a dearth and unemployed cabin crew looking for work could also boost low-cost carriers. Once-scarce landing slots at busy airports may become more available. And, if prices rise for long-haul seats, this may rekindle interest in low-cost long-haul services, which have a patchy history. The demise of Norwegian was largely down to its inability to make profits on long-haul routes. The business model of short-haul carriers does not easily translate to long-haul flights, where fuel is a bigger share of costs and schedules are compromised by time differences and airport curfews that do not affect short-haul travel. But a new plane, Airbus’s <small>A</small>321<small>XLR</small>, a single-aisle jet with the ability to fly long-haul routes, could change the equation again.</p><p >The commercial-aviation business will be smaller for years to come. Yet opportunities abound, especially if legacy carriers fail to adapt. Higher fares and lower costs will attract competitors that threaten the old guard. In 20 years’ time air travel will be back on track and growing again but the old names may no longer be on the tarmac. Just as Pan Am and <small>TWA</small> are distant memories, so a clutch of now familiar airlines may become relics of the past.<span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p><div ><strong >The future of travel<!-- --> <span >Return of the wanderer</span></strong><ul><li ><a  href="https://www.economist.comhttps://www.economist.com/special-report/2021/02/13/the-age-of-the-wheelie-bag"><span>The age of the wheelie-bag</span></a></li><li ><a  href="https://www.economist.comhttps://www.economist.com/special-report/2021/02/13/no-heads-in-the-clouds"><span>No heads in the clouds</span></a></li><li ><a  href="https://www.economist.comhttps://www.economist.com/special-report/2021/02/11/emission-days"><span>Emission days</span></a></li><li ><a  href="https://www.economist.comhttps://www.economist.com/special-report/2021/02/11/video-conferencing-rules"><span>Video-conferencing rules</span></a></li><li ><a  href="https://www.economist.comhttps://www.economist.com/special-report/2021/02/11/high-flyers"><span>High flyers</span></a></li><li ><a  href="https://www.economist.comhttps://www.economist.com/special-report/2021/02/13/well-travelled"><span>Well travelled</span></a></li><li ><a  href="https://www.economist.comhttps://www.economist.com/special-report/2021/02/13/the-holiday-only-just-began"><span>The holiday only just began</span></a></li><li ><a  href="https://www.economist.comhttps://www.economist.com/special-report/2021/02/11/faster-higher-longer"><span>Faster, higher, longer</span></a></li></ul></div><p data-test-id="Footnote" >This article appeared in the Special report section of the print edition under the headline &quot;No heads in the clouds&quot;</p>
