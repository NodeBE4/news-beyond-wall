It is a rare rock band that has not had its catalogue compiled into an affordable box set with bonus tracks and a DVD, even if hardly anyone cared about the music the first time round. Any album worth its salt (and some very much not worth their salt) re-emerges in a “legacy” or “super-deluxe” edition eventually, with a disc of demos or an added live set.</p><p >Hip-hop, however, has not really followed suit. Search for deluxe reissues of the catalogue of the Notorious B.I.G. (the stage name of Christopher Wallace) and you will find one hugely expensive vinyl box of four of the albums he was involved in—no bonus tracks, nothing extra—and one version of his debut album, “Ready to Die” (1994). These are collectors’ items only, yet for an artist who sold 30m albums, as Wallace did, you would expect a slew of special editions of his albums to be available.</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p >There are reasons why such editions have not caught on. When rappers die young—the Notorious B.I.G. was shot dead on March 9th 1997, aged 24—anything they leave unreleased tends to be rushed out as a posthumous album. There are two by Notorious B.I.G; his old rival Tupac Shakur has released seven albums since his own murder. This means there often isn’t any bonus material left for reissues or deluxe editions.</p><p >Repackaging old work can also lead to problems with licensing, particularly when the original record label no longer exists, or with securing approvals for samples on tracks that were made in the days before that became a necessity. There might be historic enmities between the principals that remain unresolved, and the business practices that hip-hop’s impresarios sometimes employed can leave the actual ownership of the recordings a mystery. Compiling a hip-hop reissue would therefore require an abundance of time and patience—which many in the music industry do not have.</p><p >Where hip-hop has celebrated its legacy, though, is in film, with dramas such as “Straight Outta Compton” (2015), the overarching documentary series “Hip-Hop Evolution” (2016-), or last year’s brilliant “Wu-Tang Clan: Of Mics and Men”. The Notorious B.I.G. is the latest star to be resurrected in this way. “Biggie: I Got A Story To Tell”, a documentary now streaming on Netflix, made with the co-operation of the rapper’s estate, is illuminating and tragic. </p><p >The film is most informative when it concentrates on the music. It explores how Donald Harrison, a jazz musician and neighbour of Wallace’s when he was a child in Clinton Hill, Brooklyn, introduced the youngster to the work of drummers such as Max Roach, and how that influenced the phrasing of the Notorious B.I.G.’s rapping, with emphasis falling in unexpected places. Tributes to his musicality are expected, yet footage of the 14-year-old Wallace recording his first demo, based around a sample of Toto’s “Africa”, suggests his interest in melody, as well as beats and rapping, developed early.</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p >A clip from a rap battle on the street in Brooklyn, with the pre-fame B.I.G. trouncing his rival, is thrilling, and proof that his gifts were genuinely remarkable. Would that there were more illustrations of what made him special rather than assertion. It’s all very well for P. Diddy, a musician and producer, to say that the Notorious B.I.G. was the greatest rapper ever; it would be more instructive to know why.</p><p >The tragedy, though, is the one familiar from more hip-hop life stories: the poor kid who drifted into drug dealing, and who escaped it via music, only to become embroiled in violence. Clearly the transition from street to studio is not easy, but it is an indictment of the music industry that so many hip-hop artists meet this fate (11 have been shot and killed in the last three years). These were not men born into bloodshed, but brought to it by circumstance, as Wallace was to selling crack. Evidently no one had tried to help them extricate themselves from it with any great commitment. So long as money is coming in, the music industry tends to forget any concept of duty of care. </p><p ><em>“Biggie: I Got A Story To Tell” is streaming on Netflix now</em></p>
