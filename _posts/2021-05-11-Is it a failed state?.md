Aung San Suu Kyi, Myanmar’s de-facto leader, has been detained on trumped-up charges. Protesters have been met with increasingly brutal force: thousands have been arrested, many have been tortured and at least 700 have been killed in street battles. They show no signs of backing down, nor does the government appear capable of imposing its will across the entire country. State failure in Myanmar would have far-reaching effects across the rest of Asia.</p><p ><iframe height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qz11hb86GwM?enablejsapi=1"></iframe></p>
