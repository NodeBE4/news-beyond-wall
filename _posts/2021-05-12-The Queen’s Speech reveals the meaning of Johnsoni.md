For Margaret Thatcher, it meant the moral and economic discipline of the free market. For David Cameron, liberal centrism and the embrace of globalisation.</p><p >Boris Johnson’s interpretation has been hard to decipher, partly because it has been obscured by the chaos of covid-19 and partly because he has never shown any commitment to a particular set of political ideas. So the Queen’s Speech, delivered on May 11th and in which the government presents its programme for the next session of Parliament, was of particular interest. It was the clearest expression so far of what might one day be called Johnsonism. </p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p >That Mr Johnson is now thought quite likely to be in power for long enough to have his own “ism” would have surprised ­many just a year ago. His management of the early stages of the pandemic was lethally slipshod and there was much grumbling about his leadership. However, on May 6th the Conservatives thumped the Labour Party in a by-election and in a series of local polls. </p><p >Mr Johnson’s popularity springs from several sources. One is a successful vaccine roll-out, and consequent liberation of the population from lockdown. Another is Mr Johnson himself. His boisterous willingness to outrage liberal sensibilities goes down well outside the cities and his finely tuned political instincts have led him to espouse a combination of cultural conservatism and statist economics that has more in common with Gaullism or Eisenhower’s “modern Republicanism” than it has with Thatcherism or Cameron-style conservatism. </p><p >Some of the intervention that the government promises is welcome. It plans to boost investment in r&amp;d and to “level up” the country by spending more money on infrastructure and on vocational education, which all need more money and attention. It promises to reform the planning system, which allows homeowners to veto development and thus condemns Britons to live in expensive rabbit-hutches. </p><p >Mr Johnson’s solution to the problem of nimbyism is to limit local authorities’ say on planning, giving central government more control over development. Whether or not he will really face down angry suburbanites in the Home Counties over new houses—he has already bottled out of a previous attempt—this approach derives from the fundamental problem with John­son­ism: his tendency to grab power. If local authorities do not want development, Mr Johnson’s answer is not to give them more say over taxation and thus an incentive to grow, but to force them to accept it. If parts of the country are poor, his answer is not to allow them to develop their own growth strategies, but to create a central fund to give them money. </p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p >The government is extending its control over the economy, too. Its plan for freeports is an attempt to direct investment to particular parts of the country. It is taking the opportunity that Brexit offers to give itself more discretion over handing out money to private companies and over using public procurement to further its levelling-up agenda. Both should send shivers down taxpayers’ spines.</p><p >The programme also includes a constitutional power grab. Mr Johnson has had it in for the judiciary ever since the Supreme Court prevented him from proroguing Parliament over Brexit—hence plans to limit the judges’ power to challenge the executive as well as to restore to the executive discretion over when to call an election, which Mr Cameron’s government had renounced. </p><p >And as state power extends, so civil liberties will be crimped. The Johnson government has entertained new restraints on protest, limitations on asylum and voter-id requirements. It looks set on meddling in culture and univer­sities. They are all designed to press culturally conservative voters’ hot-buttons.</p><p ><strong>Johnsonism unbound</strong></p><p >For a prime minister who hopes to use his newly recovered mandate to call an early election and wants to be seen to be doing stuff, the extension of central-government power has a clear appeal. For this newspaper, which puts a high price on civil liberties and believes that smaller states and freer markets make for more prosperous countries, it does not.</p><p ><span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p>
