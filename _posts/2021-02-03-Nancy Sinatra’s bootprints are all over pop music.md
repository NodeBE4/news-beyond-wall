Now 80 years old, Ms Sinatra may not have been long in the spotlight, but her music is unforgettable and her influence enduring. Four decades after Ms Sinatra’s heyday, Lana Del Rey launched herself as “the gangsta Nancy Sinatra” in the certainty everyone would understand exactly what she meant.</p><p >Ms Sinatra bore the name of one of the 20th century’s musical titans, yet she established an identity and a legacy in no way beholden to her father. Even being signed to Frank Sinatra’s record label, Reprise, and recording a global chart-topping duet with him (“Somethin’ Stupid” in 1967), didn’t confine her to his shadow. This number doesn’t feature on “Start Walkin’ 1965-1976”, a new, remastered collection; there are too many tracks of greater substance to fit in. </p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p >She was not a singer of notable technical prowess or vocal range. When Ms Sinatra recorded “You Only Live Twice” (1967), one of the most memorable James Bond themes, John Barry, the producer, assembled the final vocal from pieces of over two dozen takes. Yet her voice and image exuded personality. Her prime coincided with perhaps the most accelerated period of invention in pop, with abundant dazzling talents—The Beatles, Bob Dylan, Brian Wilson, much of the Tamla Motown operation—at their creative peaks. She held her own among them.</p><p >She did this as one of the most subversive figures in music. While the counterculture sneered or raged at the straight world, Ms Sinatra infiltrated the mainstream with bright, kitschy, seditious ditties—pop contraband brimful of smuggled filth and covert drug references (she topped Billboard’s Easy Listening chart in 1967 with “Sugar Town”, a veiled paen to LSD). Her co-conspirator in this enterprise was the late Lee Hazlewood, initially her writer and producer, thereafter her singing partner, too. Hazlewood, a formidable cult artist in his own right, has often been perceived as a Svengali figure: an older, industry-savvy veteran controlling an ingénue. But this misrepresents both their relationship and their working dynamic—they were, both always insisted, respectful (and platonic) peers.</p><p >Their collaboration produced her breakthrough hit, “These Boots Are Made For Walkin’”, as Ms Sinatra had told Hazlewood that the song demanded a female vocalist. “It sounds hateful when a man sings it,” she insisted, and she was right. Her own reading was tough, proto-feminist, a promise of retribution in kind to men who treated women like doormats. “Boots” established the style that defined her: indomitable self-assertion blended with coquettish sensuality. She could threaten, coax and titillate, sometimes all at once: the archetype of the Bad Girl who refuses to be wholesome or victimised or submissive, those being the principal roles for women pop singers before her. </p><p >Backed by the celebrated “Wrecking Crew” of session musicians, Ms Sinatra and Hazlewood turned out a series of hits, arranged by Billy Strange, whose eerie tremolo guitar became a distinctive feature of her work. It shivered through her cover of Cher’s song “Bang Bang (My Baby Shot Me Down)” (1966), later deployed to riveting effect by Quentin Tarantino in “Kill Bill: Vol. 1”. Ms Sinatra was something of an inadvertent nemesis to Cher; she and Elvis Presley starred in the successful film “Speedway” (1968), originally earmarked as a Sonny And Cher vehicle. And as the latter duo’s tandem career foundered, Ms Sinatra and Hazlewood deployed a similar yet hipper shtick on the album “Nancy And Lee” (1968), a commercial and artistic triumph that includes, in “Some Velvet Morning”, as strange and brilliant a male/female duet as has ever been recorded.</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p >Everything changed when, in the early 1970s, Hazlewood abruptly emigrated to Sweden, giving Ms Sinatra neither warning nor explanation. (His principal motivation, it later emerged, was to protect his son from being drafted to fight in Vietnam.) Although they would make two more LPs together as a duo, her career did not recover. But in truth, it was already on the way down. Her chart placings had dropped, and her moment of cultural significance had passed. She would continue to make intriguing records, and “Start Walkin’” uncovers some of these curios: “How Are Things In California?” (1970), a luscious pastiche of The Mamas and the Papas that arrived two years too late; the “Arkansas Coal” suite (1972), an ornate and dramatic rendering of a mining tragedy; “Hook And Ladder” (1971), which was well timed for the country-pop boom but missed out all the same. </p><p >Her next flash of fame would have to wait until 1995, with a photoshoot and cover for <em>Playboy</em>. “I needed the money,” she explained. “I wanted to do a recording comeback and I didn’t have the funds for it. I was a single mom.” What might, at 24, have seemed a sordid concession was, at 54, an act of boldness that many women applauded. An eye-catching promotional photo in the new compilation’s booklet shows Ms Sinatra wearing a trench coat and brandishing a selection of weaponry. The original “gangsta Nancy Sinatra”, let’s remember, was Nancy Sinatra.</p>
