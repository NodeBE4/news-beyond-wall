Based on Nella Larsen’s novel of the same name, published in 1929 during the Harlem Renaissance, the film revolves around the complicated relationship between two African-American women, Clare Kendry (Ruth Negga, pictured left) and Irene Redfield (Tessa Thompson, pictured right). The film’s biggest secret is revealed within minutes: Clare, who is biracial and pale-skinned, is passing as white. </p><p >The two women were childhood friends yet chose divergent paths. Irene married Brian (André Holland), a black doctor, and built a life among Harlem’s glitterati. At the age of 18 Clare married John Bellew (Alexander Skarsgard), a white financier and vile racist. Though Clare denies part of her heritage, she does not do so out of shame: presenting herself as white and marrying a wealthy man offered her a kind of financial security that she never enjoyed as the biracial daughter of an alcoholic janitor. </p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p >Yet when she and Irene bump into each other as adults, it sparks in Clare a desire to reconnect with the black community; thereafter she variously hides and embraces her true racial identity but finds in Harlem a kind of seductive freedom. Irene’s satisfaction with her own life is threatened by her friend’s very presence in Harlem. Clare’s conduct awakens in Irene the realisation that she is passing, too, albeit in a different way. </p><p >Both women value the safety and status that marriage promises: settling down with a banker and a doctor cemented Clare’s and Irene’s places in white and black high society. (In 1920 women made up only 20% of the workforce, according to America’s Department of Labour, and the vast majority of working women were poor and single; they often faced dangerous conditions in crowded factories.) Yet marriage is stifling, too, and neither woman seems to love her husband. Clare admits to finding John revolting, and Irene prizes her own security above Brian’s desire to move abroad to escape America’s racism.</p><p >Clare and Irene are also passing for devoted mothers. When Irene asks Clare to think of her daughter, and what might happen to her if John were to find out about her sojourns in Harlem, Clare replies: “I think being a mother is the cruellest thing in the world.” Irene doesn’t object. Dutifully, but in agreement, she answers, “Yes, and the most responsible.”</p><p >Perhaps the most inscrutable layer of the film involves Clare’s and Irene’s sexuality. There is an erotic tension between the two women, revealed only by lingering glances and the occasional touch. Is it attraction, admiration or jealousy? Each marvels at her friend’s nature—one vibrant and thrill-seeking, the other poised to a fault. The film can only hint at what the book makes explicit with Irene’s inner monologue, wherein she notes Clare’s “tempting” mouth, and the feeling of being “caressed” when she smiles. In lieu of this narration the film uses close-ups, which accentuate Irene’s face as her expression flits from surprise to anger to adoration while listening to Clare talk about how passing as white has left her without anyone to confide in. </p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p >“Passing” insists that it is normal, imperative even, to embrace complexity. Maybe Irene does have romantic feelings for Clare; she may also hate her for casting off her blackness or envy her casual disregard of danger. All of these things can be true at once. Throughout the film characters are consciously and unconsciously performing the idea of a white woman, a loyal husband, a devoted mother, a loving wife, a straight woman or a wealthy socialite. In acknowledging the careful way each character constructs their identity, “Passing” prompts the viewer to think just as much about the constraints of class, gender and sexuality as they do about race.</p><p ><em>“Passing” had its premiere at Sundance Film Festival and has been acquired by Netflix</em></p>
