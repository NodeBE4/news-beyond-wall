One of the world’s largest container ships was wedged athwart the Suez Canal on March 23rd, blown off course by high winds. The problem for global shipping seems as immense.</p><p >Nearly 19,000 vessels plied the 193km maritime shortcut last year, carrying 12% of global trade by volume and around 10% of the world’s oil. Even a short closure of the bottleneck threatens severe disruption; supply chains linking Asia and Europe are “stretched to the limit” as it is, notes Greg Knowler of <small>JOC</small>, a research firm. The price of crude shot up by 5% on news of the accident.</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p >The blockage of a big source of foreign earnings will have worried Egypt’s government. It has been trying to drum up more business for the canal. In 2015 it spent $8bn on an expansion project to cut waiting times. Despite the pandemic revenues dipped only slightly in 2020 compared with the year before, to $5.6bn. That is in part because Egypt cut transit fees last year for some vessels—of as much as $700,000 for an <em>Ever Given</em>—to stop them choosing the alternative route around the Cape of Good Hope, which takes a week longer but is affordable thanks to low fuel prices.</p><p >More oil may eventually travel by different means. Pipeline deals like a proposed one between Israeli and Emirati investors look plausible as relations between the Jewish state and its Arab neighbours thaw. A thawing Arctic may open up other routes that compete with Suez. But in the short run the canal is likely to remain a conduit for crude, and much else besides. Once, that is, <em>Ever Given</em> is back on course<em>.</em></p><p data-test-id="Footnote" >This article appeared in the Business section of the print edition under the headline &quot;Chokehold&quot;</p><br><hr><div>获取更多RSS：<br><a href="https://feedx.net" style="color:orange" target="_blank">https://feedx.net</a> <br><a href="https://feedx.top" style="color:orange" target="_blank">https://feedx.top</a><br></div>
