They promised that automation in the office and robots on the factory floor might permanently destroy millions of jobs. In 2016 one respected analyst predicted that one in six American jobs would be lost by 2025. Yet just before the coronavirus rampaged through the global economy, the oecd, a club of mostly rich nations, was reporting record levels of employment among its member countries.</p><p >Instead it was the pandemic, not robots or smart software, that caused tens of millions of job losses, and for rather conventional reasons: recession, a decline in consumer spending and companies going out of business. Firms that had invested in advanced technologies, far from laying people off, went on a hiring spree. Amazon, renowned for its cutting-edge acumen, recruited an additional 175,000 people as lockdowns began in March 2020. Netflix, a technology-driven media company, continued to hire throughout the pandemic. Academic evidence on whether artificial intelligence and industrial robots hurt employment remains inconclusive. Predictions of the number of jobs at risk have declined, and in some cases gone negative. A recent European Commission paper suggested that “robot adoption tends to be positively associated with aggregate employment”, and a study by Leslie Willocks, an economist at the London School of Economics, reached a similar conclusion.</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p >Even if robots have yet to take all the jobs, technology is fundamentally reshaping the nature of work in other ways, as firms rethink their businesses after the pandemic. There will be new skills to learn, new responsibilities to master and new models of remote and hybrid working. Employees will be forced to adapt. Such constant change will be unsettling. Not everyone relishes working in an environment where what they do, who they work with and the skills they need change regularly. Firms that do not adopt these new, technology-enabled ways of working risk going the way of Blockbuster, Kodak or BlackBerry.</p><p >Companies may be tempted to use the rupture provided by the pandemic to adopt new labour practices. They may, for example, place greater reliance on gig-work platforms, paying workers for specific tasks or projects, rather than employing them. For firms, the benefit is clear: a contractor comes and does the job without being a lingering payroll liability. Though some workers appreciate and benefit from the flexibility that gig working offers, it does not afford the economic security or personal-development opportunities of a full-time job.</p><p >Ensuring that technology-driven change benefits workers as well as companies will require new thinking from employers. The good news is that there are signs of progress. Many large firms are investing in re-skilling their workforces for the future. In 2020 PWC, a consultancy, announced that it would invest $3bn to re-train its 275,000 employees. IBM, a computer giant, has promised $1bn for re-training its workforce. Amazon has committed $700m. More firms will follow suit.</p><p >Smaller entrepreneurial outfits are dealing with workers’ emerging needs. Lambda School, based in Silicon Valley, trains software developers, and defers its fees until graduates have found jobs paying more than $50,000 a year. Portify helps freelance workers, whose earnings may not be backed by a giant industrial conglomerate, build up their credit ratings. Firms like Hustle and Zego provide gig workers with affordable insurance while they are on the job; Collective Benefits helps gig workers with holiday pay and sick leave.</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p >Policymakers need to act, too. As gig-working has already shown, employment law should be updated to reflect the shifting rights and responsibilities associated with new, technology-enabled styles of working. Although the threat of a robot-job apocalypse seems to have been postponed, workers can still find themselves on the wrong end of technological change. Devising a new and fairer settlement requires further innovation.<span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p><p ><em>This article appeared in the Aftershocks section of the print edition of The World in 2021 under the headline “It’s time for a new deal for workers”</em></p>
