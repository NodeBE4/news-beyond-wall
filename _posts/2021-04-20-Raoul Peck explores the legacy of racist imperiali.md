Narrated by Mr Peck, a Haitian film-maker, the cumulative effect on the viewer of these episodes is a sense of being battered, to be left by turns dismayed and exhausted by the telling of atrocities.</p><p >Mr Peck is best known for his much-lauded documentary of 2016, “I Am Not Your Negro”, which explored the history of racism in America. This time he offers an even broader perspective, though he concedes from the start that he is setting out a “story” and not offering “a contribution to historical research”. He offers a warning not to accept all of what is presented as accurate or complete. Stories, he notes, are always “fabricated” or unreliable in some fashion.</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p >In this documentary some scenes are outright fiction. In one, the film-maker imagines Christopher Columbus and his crew being murdered on arrival in the New World. In another, supposed to take place in a central African forest, an African missionary briefly objects as black slave-traders march dozens of chained white children through the trees. Any history is told by those with power, notes Mr Peck, who marvels at one point that he is making his documentary at all. “Any historical narrative is a particular bundle of silences,” he says. The job of a historian—and by extension a documentary-maker—is to “deconstruct those silences”.</p><p >What silences demand his attention? Mr Peck’s story is that white Americans have never been made to face up to how their ancestors massacred Native Americans and grew rich by stealing their lands. Nor have they ever properly accounted for the cruelties of the transatlantic slave trade and the need for reparations for descendants of the victims. The persistence of violent white supremacy in America today, he says, is the direct result of a failure to confront the legacy of centuries of slavery. Europeans, meanwhile, still fail to admit the depravity of their colonial rule.</p><p >His case is mostly built on the work of a friend, a radical Swedish author, Sven Lindqvist (who died in 2019), as well as writing by anti-imperialist and anti-racist historians in the United States. Lindqvist’s best-known book from 1992 was also titled “Exterminate All the Brutes” (he borrowed the line from Joseph Conrad’s novel, “Heart of Darkness”). It suggested that the genocidal crimes of the Nazis were not an exception to the behaviour of Europeans and Americans of recent centuries. Instead, Lindqvist said, the Nazis built on values that arose directly from what had come before: racist imperialism.</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p >Mr Peck takes up that case. In this telling, imperialists saw the extermination of “lower races” in parts of Africa, Asia or North America as justified, even inevitable, as they brought commerce, Christianity and civilisation to new lands. Hitler supposedly applied the same murderous logic to 20th-century Europe. “The road to Auschwitz was paved in the earliest days of Christendom,” Mr Peck says.</p><p >By the 19th century, Europeans’ military superiority over the peoples of the rest of the world led many to reckon themselves morally and biologically superior too, he says. He dwells, often for uncomfortably long shots and re-enactments, on many examples. The brutality of Belgian colonial rulers in Congo, who murdered and mutilated people to hurry the extraction of rubber, is one case. He points to mass slaughter (by British and French armies most notably) of poorly armed opponents in battle in Africa. And he sets out how German colonists in what is today Namibia openly sought to exterminate the Herero people in the early 20th century, by driving around 80,000 of them into the desert to die. The goal, as elsewhere, was to seize their land.</p><p >Such acts created the conditions for Nazism in Europe, Mr Peck maintains. (He warns, too, that forms of fascism may be returning today.) Hitler spoke of taking inspiration from white Americans’ dispossession and mass killing of Native Americans. The Nazi leader saw their annihilation and the westward expansion of territory in the United States as a model for his own country’s push for <em>Lebensraum</em>, living space, and its murderous expansion eastwards.</p><p >As a documentary, this work is often unsettling. Archival photos and film of actual atrocities—piles of corpses in mass graves; footage of summary executions shown with no explanation; close-ups on the wounded and dying—are interspersed with animations, re-enactments of murders, and snippets of Hollywood movies and musicals. Many segments are set, jarringly, to pop or funk music from the 1970s. In one scene, footage of marching Nazis in Berlin is accompanied by Edward Elgar’s “Land of Hope and Glory”. Mr Peck appears to be saying that British imperial rule, or American democracy, were and are not really different in kind from the evils of the Third Reich.</p><p >The style can be bludgeoning. Some for whom the material is not already familiar may be horrified by it and see history in a new way. But by showing, and dwelling intimately on, so many killings he risks numbing his viewers as much as enlightening them. In individual moments the jumbling together of memoir, fictionalised re-enactments and genuine news footage is striking. The total effect of it all, however, can be less striking.</p><p >Is his radical argument also convincing? His “people’s history” approach will be seen by many as too simplistic, though he is surely right that descendants of imperialists, or those who were paid to hunt and kill Native Americans, try to avoid admitting ugly facts about their families’ pasts. It is correct that without a proper reckoning over slavery, America will struggle to address racism today. And residents of Liverpool, Nantes, Brussels and elsewhere may well need reminding of how colonial exploitation, and profits from the slave trade, helped pay for some of the grandest buildings in their cities.</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-3"></div></div></div><p >But many will also disagree with a core assertion made by Mr Peck. He says one sentence, the call to “exterminate all the brutes”, best sums up the history of the Western world. In his telling European powers (and then Europeans in North America) triumphed over other rich and sophisticated nations, such as China and India, not because of advantages bestowed by guns, germs and steel, but only as a result of their exceptional ruthlessness. Western Europeans came to dominate the globe in recent centuries, he says, because of their unique “willingness to exterminate whole civilisations of people in order to possess their land”.</p><p >Does he really believe that? In this documentary he pays no serious attention to genocides, and the slaughter of tens of millions of people, which took place in the Soviet Union, Armenia, China, Cambodia, Burundi and Rwanda—just to name a few from the last century—because they did not directly involve West Europeans or Americans. Had he looked at them, that might have distracted from his provocative claim. In any historical narrative, including this one, a particular bundle of silences can be revealing.</p><p ><em>“Exterminate All the Brutes” is available to watch in America via HBO. It will have its premiere in Britain on Sky Documentaries on May 1st</em></p>
