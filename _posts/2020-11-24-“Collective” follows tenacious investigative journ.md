As part of their performance Goodbye to Gravity, a local metal band, had set off sparklers which caught on the venue’s flammable polyurethane foam. At least 27 people died at the scene and almost 200 more were hurt. Some patients with serious injuries were transferred to hospitals in Europe; many were taken to local facilities ill-equipped to treat severe burns, where some later died. Thousands marched to protest against the government, which they perceived to be corrupt. Victor Ponta, the prime minister, resigned in November 2015.</p><p >What happened next is the subject of “Collective”, a remarkable new documentary directed by Alexander Nanau. In the wake of the tragedy the <em>Sports Gazette</em>, a newspaper, began an investigation headed by Catalin Tolontan (pictured), one of their editors. (Though chiefly a sports publication, the <em>Gazette</em> had done hard-hitting stories for many years, including probes into corrupt sports ministers.) Mr Nanau, who had also been researching the events, secured the <em>Gazette</em>’s approval to shadow their journalists at work. He starts filming as the newspaper is about to publish a major scoop: a pharmaceutical company had been diluting its disinfectants, leaving the Colectiv victims vulnerable to bacteria. Many died in hospital not primarily from their injuries, but from infections developed while in medical care.</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p >That is just one in a series of discoveries made by the <em>Gazette</em>’s reporters, and Mr Nanau skilfully chronicles the painstaking work involved in such an inquiry. Mr Tolontan works the phones and forges relationships with would-be whistleblowers, learning of kickbacks and cronyism; his colleagues go on stakeouts, taking long-range photographs of persons of interest. The owner of the pharmaceutical company dies in a car crash that is ruled a suicide. Press conferences with health ministers give the impression that those in charge are not up to the task of preventing more deaths; one of their rank resigns. </p><p >“Collective” manages to be gripping as any procedural film. The documentary has a similar feel to “All the President’s Men” (1976) as the <em>Gazette</em> holds its government to account as doggedly as Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein did America’s. That earlier film showed journalists turning up at sources’ houses or extracting information over the telephone. “Collective” evokes such incremental drama and an early scene, when Mr Tolontan and his colleagues meet an informant at night, recalls Mr Woodward’s clandestine rendezvous with Deep Throat.</p><p >The big difference with “All the President’s Men”, of course, is that Mr Nanau is shooting a documentary: he cannot stage the revelations in quite the same way—or light a garage to moody perfection—as that film did. But the director’s use of <em>cinéma vérité</em> techniques keeps the human drama close at hand. His watchful camera captures a new minister chuckling over the <em>Gazette</em>’s story about his debut press conference and a source offering an audiotape of an abusive hospital manager. There are amusing cutaways to a dutiful editor named Mirela Neag, who looks perpetually harried.</p><p >Mr Nanau says the purpose of his film is not to tell Romanians who to vote for. “I see myself as a storyteller,” he says; he is most interested in human behaviour and in the emotional repercussions of the fire. “Collective” ends by following a victim’s family as they visit their son’s grave. The film derives some of its power from recognising that even successful investigations do not immediately lead to justice for all.</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p ><em>“Collective” is available to <a href="https://www.economist.comhttps://www.collectivefilm.co.uk/">watch online</a> now</em></p>
