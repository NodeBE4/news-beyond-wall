Those on the old council estates, “when not politically apathetic, used to lean <small>UKIP</small> [ <small>UK</small> Independence Party] and now tend towards Boris Johnson”. Mr Saul is the newly-elected Labour county councillor for the Oxfordshire market town of Chipping Norton, which bustles with yoga studios and pet spas. Its deep-blue constituency of Witney, with a Tory majority of over 15,000, was once represented by David Cameron, whose circle became known as the “Chipping Norton set”.</p><p >As well as being defeated in a by-election in Hartlepool, in the north-east, Labour lost ground in pro-Brexit small towns across the North and the Midlands in this month’s local elections. But it also racked up some smaller victories in what had been Tory turf. It won the mayoralties of the West of England, and of Cambridgeshire and Peterborough, from the Tories. Greens and Liberal Democrats also made inroads into Tory areas like Suffolk and Cambridgeshire respectively. The Tories lost control of the council of Tunbridge Wells, the Kent town which serves as a synonym for southern English affluence.</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p >In 2019 the Conservatives won parliamentary seats across northern England and the Midlands, mostly by converting Labour’s working-class voters. Mr Johnson has now consolidated those gains. More former Brexit Party and <small>UKIP</small> voters have come onside, giving the Tories control of the councils of Leave-leaning Cannock Chase, and Nuneaton and Bedworth. Yet the great Brexit realignment means that Labour, Liberal Democrats and Greens are now making inroads in traditional Tory areas that had leaned Remain.</p><div ><figure><div itemscope="" itemProp="image" itemType="https://schema.org/ImageObject" data-slim="1"><meta itemProp="url" content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/739/90/sites/default/files/images/print-edition/20210515_BRC248.png"/><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/739/90/sites/default/files/images/print-edition/20210515_BRC248.png"  sizes="300px" alt=""/></div></figure><p >Voters with degrees and those who work in management are gravitating towards Labour, while Tories have made inroads among manual workers and adults without university qualifications (see chart) northern gains, Chipping Norton is thriving. It has a new retail park, and 1,200 new homes are planned. Its very success presents Tories with a Catch-22. Homeowners have been a bedrock of Tory support since Thatcher’s days, but in the Tory heartlands of southern England affordable homes are in short supply. The government plans to liberalise planning laws, which risks angering homeowners. In Chipping Norton Labour artfully drew support from both from renters frustrated by high house prices and their wealthier neighbours, unhappy about new development. In nearby Witney worries about big housing developments were also key in the victory of a local Green candidate for the district council.</p><p >Culture matters too. Mr Johnson has offended the sensibilities of the liberal professionals whom Mr Cameron wooed. A hard Brexit, tougher migration rules that restrict the supply of European au pairs and restaurant staff, and cuts to foreign aid all run against the grain of these areas.</p><p >But gains in these areas alone would not provide Labour with a viable path to power. The party needs to gain 128 seats at the next election to get a majority. The graduate vote is concentrated in urban areas, giving it big margins in cities but not elsewhere. Analysis by Onward, a think-tank close to the Conservatives, suggests that changes in electoral geography mean the Tories could gain another 50 seats at the next election, while simultaneously losing 37 mostly in their southern heartlands. Much will depend on whether disaffected Tory voters consolidate around single parties, or whether they split among Labour, Liberal Democrats and Greens.</p><p >Mr Johnson’s seat of Uxbridge and South Ruislip in graduate-rich London could be within Labour’s grasp at the next election. But it will probably be some time before Mr Cameron’s former seat goes the same way as Sedgefield, the former constituency of Tony Blair, and ends up in enemy hands. <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p></div><p ><em>For more coverage of matters relating to Brexit, visit our <a href="https://www.economist.com/brexit"> Brexit hub</a></em></p><p data-test-id="Footnote" >This article appeared in the Britain section of the print edition under the headline &quot;The Chipping Norton reset&quot;</p>
