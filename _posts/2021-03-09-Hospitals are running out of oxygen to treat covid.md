For about $60 per week, Mr Sandoval will deliver and install a pressurised cylinder of the gas. For those who prefer to buy their own, he can import one from China for around $400. Hawkers like Mr Sandoval are sprouting up in dozens of mostly poor countries to satisfy soaring demand for oxygen to treat covid-19 patients. It is a cruel irony: oxygen is the most abundant element on Earth, yet its scarcity in hospitals is causing thousands of preventable deaths. A coalition of international health organisations, investors and government agencies is trying to solve the problem. It will not be easy.</p><p >There is no question that demand for oxygen is outstripping supply amid the pandemic. Hospitals around the world are reporting shortages of the life-saving gas. But determining the size of the shortfall can be devilishly difficult, owing to differences in the length of time that patients stay in hospital and the amount of oxygen they are given (which can vary anywhere from six to 50 litres per minute depending on the severity of the infection). One way to gauge the scope of the problem in a given country is to look at the number of severe and critical covid-19 cases being reported to public-health authorities. Using this method, PATH, a Seattle-based NGO, reckons that as of March 1st demand in low- and middle-income countries alone exceeds 1.1m cylinders (7.9m cubic metres) of oxygen per day.</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p >Efforts to meet this demand are often hamstrung by poor infrastructure. In rich countries, hospitals are equipped with large tanks that can store oxygen, monitor supply levels and pipe it directly to patients in their beds. In poor countries, however, they rely mainly on individual cylinders, which creates a host of logistical headaches—from distribution to compatibility with other hospital equipment. Hospitals in remote areas may be hundreds of miles from the nearest oxygen supplier. Once the gas is acquired, they may not have the staff or technical expertise to administer it properly.</p><p >The commercial supply chain poses other problems. Medical-grade oxygen is produced by separating air into its individual components (ambient air is a mixture of 78% nitrogen, 21% oxygen and other gases). Concentrators, suitcase-sized devices, can do this in small quantities, but for larger amounts more sophisticated machinery is needed. Factories capable of producing large quantities of oxygen are often owned by commercial gas companies for which medical-grade oxygen is a side product. In many countries, the market is dominated by a few companies that lack the incentive to produce oxygen at a scale to meet demand.</p><p >Governments can do more, too, says Jayasree Iyer, executive director of Access to Medicine Foundation, a non-profit. They can list oxygen as an essential medicine, include it in government tenders and reimburse hospitals so patients do not have to pay out of pocket for treatment. “If they put medical oxygen as their priority, money will start flowing, governments will start ordering and the private sector will start selling,” Ms Iyer says. But Jim Stunkel, head of operations at Assist International, a non-profit, says channeling funds to local projects can be difficult even when countries prioritise oxygen. And for an aid plan to be effective, it must take into account technical training and equipment maintenance.</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p >One silver lining to the oxygen crisis is that it is spurring action to solve a chronic global health problem. Pneumonia kills millions of people every year. For children under five, it is the leading cause of death. Investors, gas suppliers and public-health agencies are pledging to make oxygen more available, and their efforts will benefit poor countries even after the pandemic is over. Such partnerships have proved successful in the past. In 2019 the GE Foundation (the big engineering firm’s philanthropic arm), working with Assist International, an American NGO, opened two oxygen plants in Ethiopia’s Amhara region. The plants now produce 240 cylinders per day for hospitals in the area.</p>
