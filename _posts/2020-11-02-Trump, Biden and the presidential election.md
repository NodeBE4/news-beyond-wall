The country he is asking to re-elect him is more unhappy and more divided. That is in part the consequence of four years of his leadership. Partisanship, buck-passing and lies—and that was before the shameful death toll of covid-19—are just some of the reasons why, if we had a vote in this year’s election, <a href="https://www.economist.com/leaders/2020/10/29/why-it-has-to-be-biden">it would go to Joe Biden</a>. He is not a miracle cure for what ails America, but he is a good man who would restore civility to the White House. His <a href="https://www.economist.com/briefing/2020/10/03/joe-biden-would-not-remake-americas-economy">economic plan</a> is pragmatic, rather than visionary. Mr Trump has had a baleful effect on America’s <a href="https://www.economist.com/briefing/2020/10/29/president-trump-has-had-real-achievements-and-a-baleful-effect">domestic</a> and <a href="https://www.economist.com/briefing/2020/10/29/president-trumps-criticisms-of-the-world-order-had-some-merit">foreign</a> policy. Our <a href="https://www.economist.comhttps://projects.economist.com/us-2020-forecast/president">presidential forecast</a> gives Mr Biden a 95% chance of winning the electoral college.</p><hr/><div ><figure><div itemscope="" itemProp="image" itemType="https://schema.org/ImageObject" data-slim="1"><meta itemProp="url" content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/917/90/sites/default/files/20201107_WOC108_1.png"/><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/917/90/sites/default/files/20201107_WOC108_1.png"  sizes="300px" alt=""/></div></figure><p ><strong>Joe Biden really is in pole position</strong></p><p >There have been plenty of unpredictable events and attention-grabbing news stories in 2020, but only a few have affected voters’ intentions. <a href="https://www.economist.com/united-states/2020/11/01/joe-biden-really-is-in-pole-position">Joe Biden</a> started to open a lead in April and has not looked back since. According to The Economist’s forecast <a href="https://www.economist.comhttps://projects.economist.com/us-2020-forecast/president">model</a>, he has a 19-in-20 chance of winning the election. President Trump’s support has never climbed above 47%, and has hovered closer to 45% for much of the time since June 1st. That puts him in the company of George H.W. Bush and Jimmy Carter, two other incumbent presidents who failed to win a second term. The high-profile misfire of the polls in 2016 has made observers more cautious about predicting the president’s defeat, but there are several reasons to put more stock in them this time.</p></div><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-1"></div></div></div><hr/><div ><figure><div itemscope="" itemProp="image" itemType="https://schema.org/ImageObject" data-slim="1"><meta itemProp="url" content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/800/90/sites/default/files/images/articles/20201031_usp510_0.jpg"/><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/800/90/sites/default/files/images/articles/20201031_usp510_0.jpg"  sizes="300px" alt=""/></div></figure><p ><strong>The Trump audit part 1: domestic</strong></p><p >America <a href="https://www.economist.com/briefing/2020/10/29/president-trump-has-had-real-achievements-and-a-baleful-effect">hardly feels great again</a>. There are 11m fewer people working than in February. <a href="https://www.economist.com/united-states/2020/10/03/measuring-poverty-in-the-midst-of-americas-covid-19-epidemic">Hunger and poverty</a> have risen; the memories of a <a href="https://www.economist.com/united-states/2020/08/29/wisconsins-summer-of-fury">turbulent summer</a> of protests and racial unrest are still raw. At least 227,000 people are dead because of <a href="https://www.economist.comhttps://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2020/07/24/the-march-of-the-coronavirus-across-america">covid-19</a>. And both caseloads and hospitalisations are surging for a third time. On October 23rd America recorded nearly 84,000 new cases, the highest daily tally so far. Were it not for the pandemic, Donald Trump might be on the brink of re-election. Until the epidemic hit, he had made good on his promise to <a href="https://www.economist.com/united-states/2020/10/14/how-the-american-economy-did-under-donald-trump">keep America’s economy growing</a>. Still, he has presided over a nation that is ever more divided and a swamp that remains undrained.</p></div><hr/><div ><figure><div itemscope="" itemProp="image" itemType="https://schema.org/ImageObject" data-slim="1"><meta itemProp="url" content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/800/90/sites/default/files/images/articles/20201031_usp509_0.jpg"/><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/800/90/sites/default/files/images/articles/20201031_usp509_0.jpg"  sizes="300px" alt=""/></div></figure><p ><strong>The Trump audit part II: foreign</strong></p><p >Donald Trump’s criticism of the world order <a href="https://www.economist.com/briefing/2020/10/29/president-trumps-criticisms-of-the-world-order-had-some-merit">had some merit</a>. He recognised the importance of Asia, and also noted that America needed to pay more attention to its domestic troubles. The public was weary with “forever wars”, and he has placated them by winding down military activities in <a href="https://www.economist.com/asia/2020/07/02/america-is-rapidly-pulling-troops-from-afghanistan">Afghanistan</a>. But at the end of his first term, the world order is in a worse shape than Mr Trump found it in. America’s reputation abroad has plunged during Mr Trump’s presidency. He has abandoned military wars but embraced the trade variety; they provide a form of combat, brash and performative, which he relishes. He has achieved “the rare diplomatic feat of pissing off the Canadians” and has <a href="https://www.economist.com/leaders/2020/01/02/dont-be-fooled-by-the-trade-deal-between-america-and-china">burned bridges with China</a>. He has attempted to inveigle political favours from the president of Ukraine, which led to his <a href="https://www.economist.com/united-states/2020/01/25/the-strange-impeachment-trial-of-donald-trump">impeachment</a> trial. America’s foreign relations are in dire need of repair.</p></div><hr/><div ><figure><div itemscope="" itemProp="image" itemType="https://schema.org/ImageObject" data-slim="1"><meta itemProp="url" content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/800/90/sites/default/files/images/articles/20201107_usp501.jpg"/><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/800/90/sites/default/files/images/articles/20201107_usp501.jpg"  sizes="300px" alt=""/></div></figure><p ><strong>Bidenomics</strong></p><p >Some leaders, when they come into office, have a powerful economic vision for transforming how their country creates wealth and distributes it. Others approach power as pragmatists whose goal is to subtly shape the political and economic forces they inherit. <a href="https://www.economist.com/briefing/2020/10/03/joe-biden-would-not-remake-americas-economy">Joe Biden</a> is firmly in the second camp. He is a lifelong centrist whose most enduring economic belief is his admiration for hard-working Americans and who has shifted with the centre of gravity in his party. But if Mr Biden enters the Oval Office in January 2021 he will confront an extraordinary set of circumstances that will put a huge amount of pressure on him. Covid-19 has scarred the economy, with <a href="https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2020/06/05/american-unemployment-falls-but-normality-is-still-far-away">millions of people unemployed</a> and public debts that will soon exceed their all-time high of 106% of GDP. At the same time Mr Biden will head up a party that has shifted to the left and a country that is wary of globalisation</p></div><hr/><div ><figure><div itemscope="" itemProp="image" itemType="https://schema.org/ImageObject" data-slim="1"><meta itemProp="url" content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/800/90/sites/default/files/images/articles/20201031_usp513_0.jpg"/><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/800/90/sites/default/files/images/articles/20201031_usp513_0.jpg"  sizes="300px" alt=""/></div></figure><p ><strong>How Donald Trump might yet win the election</strong></p><p >We think the president will lose on November 3rd. But there are a few forces <a href="https://www.economist.com/united-states/2020/10/24/if-donald-trump-were-to-win-re-election-how-would-he-do-it">working in his favour</a>. During the pandemic Republicans have been out canvassing more than Democrats. If those efforts translate into gains in voter registration and turnout in key states, Joe Biden should be worried. In Arizona, for example, the Republicans have registered over 30,000 more voters than the Democrats since mid-August. Undecided voters are younger and less white than the average voter who has decided, meaning that they are more likely to vote for Mr Biden. But Donald Trump has urged his supporters to “go into the polls and watch very carefully”. Poll-watchers are a routine presence, but many read Mr Trump’s remark as a call for voter intimidation. Another uncertainty concerns the counting of ballots. Many worry that posted ballots will be rejected at higher rates than in-person votes, which would place Democrats at a disadvantage.</p></div><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-2"></div></div></div><hr/><div ><figure><div itemscope="" itemProp="image" itemType="https://schema.org/ImageObject" data-slim="1"><meta itemProp="url" content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/800/90/sites/default/files/images/articles/20201031_usp515_0.jpg"/><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/800/90/sites/default/files/images/articles/20201031_usp515_0.jpg"  sizes="300px" alt=""/></div></figure><p ><strong>Latino men are a bright spot in Donald Trump’s faltering campaign</strong></p><p >Donald Trump has transformed Texas from a jewel in the Republican crown to a key battleground. If he holds the state, <a href="https://www.economist.com/united-states/2020/10/27/latino-men-are-a-bright-spot-in-donald-trumps-faltering-campaign">he may have Latino men to thank</a>. National polls place Mr Trump about seven percentage points behind his opponent compared with 2016. But his support among Latinos has bucked the trend, even creeping up slightly; and men tend to favour Mr Trump more than women. Latino men have moved further towards Mr Trump in this cycle than just about any other group. He has stopped referring to Mexican men as “bad hombres” in his rallies, and is more concerned with chasing the shadows of Antifa than with migration.</p></div>
