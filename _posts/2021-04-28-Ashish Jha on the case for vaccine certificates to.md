Should you know? How can you keep yourself and your workplace safe in a way that is equitable and protects privacy? As countries administer covid-19 vaccines, having a vaccine certificate—a simple, reliable and secure way to determine who is inoculated—will be critical to making work, school, restaurants, houses of worship and other places safe for everyone.</p><p >In America, many universities have announced plans to bring students back to campus for in-person classes by mandating vaccinations. Without a mandate, many students might forgo a jab, making classrooms a hotbed of covid-19 infections, and leading everyone back to remote classes, mask wearing and social distancing. Hence universities—like Brown, where I teach—have decided that the in-person educational experience is worth requiring vaccination. They are right.</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p >The importance of knowing who has been vaccinated and how safe it is to gather together extends far beyond schools. Ensuring that people feel confident to interact in public is vital to economic revival. Offices, hotels, restaurants and transport firms would substantially boost people’s sense of security by ensuring that everyone sharing the airspace is vaccinated. Individuals and businesses need a way to create virus-free environments for people to interact: the question is not whether to do it, but how.</p><p >The state of New York has rolled out a smartphone app that verifies a person’s vaccination status or recent negative test result, allowing admission to public events like baseball games. Hawaii plans to pilot a programme exempting those who can show proof of vaccination from mandatory quarantine requirements. Israel, which has already rolled out a “green pass” system, plans to open the programme to international travelers who can show proof of vaccination.</p><p >All of these systems rely on the same principle: allowing individuals to certify that they do not pose a significant risk of covid infection to others so they can take part in activities that might otherwise be unacceptably risky for both the individual and the community. Unvaccinated people have no right to impose such risks on others, particularly when effective vaccines become more widely available. Allowing businesses and universities to return to a new normal by making informed choices about risk is how society will reopen in the months to come.</p><p >Still there are those who object to vaccine certificates, concerned they will do more harm than good. Those objections need to be refuted.</p><p >Some people worry that vaccine certificates will worsen equity. In a world where vaccine supply is limited and access to them inequitably distributed, it doesn’t seem fair to open society to the vaccinated but not the rest. But over time, there will be fewer and fewer people unable to access a vaccine, at least in some countries. In America, every adult is entitled to a free vaccine now, and can get one quickly. In most of Europe, broad access will happen by summer. At that point, excluding the unvaccinated will mean barring those who have chosen to forgo vaccinations.</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p >Privacy and security are also a worry. Simple tools like a paper vaccine card are subject to counterfeit or can be lost. A secure, authenticated approach is critical to protect privacy and ensure the appropriate use of data. In countries with a long tradition of national identification cards, it will make sense for the government to fulfil this function. In America, proof of vaccination is more likely to be issued by health providers or other private entities such as tech companies because of the public’s hostility to government oversight. However, the government can still ensure these firms use authenticated and secure sources of information to prevent counterfeits or privacy violations.</p><p >Some people regard vaccine certificates as an infringement on personal freedom. This is nonsense. A person who chooses to remain unvaccinated need not be denied their basic rights, notably the ability to access essential government services. But there is no fundamental right to board a flight or attend a football game when you pose a hazard to others. Companies offering those services have a clear and compelling need to make their business activities safe. They can choose to exclude anyone they want for almost any reason they want, as long as it is not for specifically forbidden reasons (such as a person’s race, ethnicity, gender and so forth).</p><p >Still other people may argue that religious freedom is at stake. This also doesn’t hold up. Religious leaders, including the Pope and senior clergy in America’s Christian Evangelical movement like Franklin Graham, have advocated for vaccinations. Islamic religious leaders have argued that it is acceptable to get vaccinated while fasting during Ramadan. In the absence of mainstream religious objections to vaccinations, vaccine certifications do not discriminate against any major religious group.</p><p >The idea of requiring proof of vaccination is hardly without precedent. Global travelers have been required to prove vaccination against yellow fever for decades. Colleges and schools mandate vaccines regularly. As a physician, I will be barred from treating patients if I choose not to show proof of my influenza vaccination every year. Covid-19 is certainly no less a threat than influenza or yellow fever.</p><p >The World Health Organisation is <a href="https://www.economist.comhttps://www.who.int/news-room/articles-detail/interim-position-paper-considerations-regarding-proof-of-covid-19-vaccination-for-international-travellers">opposed to requiring proof</a> of vaccination for international travel, in part because much of the world lacks access to vaccines. But its guidance will probably change as more vaccines become available. We need to jumpstart the global economy and allow travel to resume, and that means allowing people to safely visit other countries and avoid long quarantines, which can only happen with proof of vaccination. This should behoove the West to invest more in vaccination programmes in other countries.</p><p >To be sure, vaccination certificates are unlikely to be needed over time. As the world reaches herd immunity, countries will worry less about infections. Testing can be used to identify outbreaks or the stray traveler with the virus. Many indoor venues, such as theaters and retail stores, will decide that they no longer need to check the certificates. But that is still many months, and possibly years, away. Until then, vaccine certificates will be a crucial tool in the fight against covid-19.</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-3"></div></div></div><p >How can those who favour vaccine passports respond to concerns by critics? One way would be to set a public target. This borrows from an approach by West Virginia Governor Jim Justice, who said the state will lift a mandate that face masks be worn indoors in public places once the state vaccination rate hits 70%. Similarly, for vaccine certificates, governments could set a goal at which they would no longer be required (though the target would be closer to a 90% vaccination rate for population-level immunity). The target, along with an “expiration date” for certificates, may motivate people to get their jabs—and increase acceptance for vaccine certificates.</p><p >Vaccines offer a way out of the pandemic. The path will be long, bumpy and uneven. Until both America and the world reach herd immunity, governments will need to manage risk. Yet vaccinations are only part of the solution, they are not the goal, which is to make communities safe and let normal life resume. For that, vaccine certificates are needed so everyone’s full participation in society can be restored.</p><p ><em>Ashish Jha is Dean of the Brown University School of Public Health</em></p>
