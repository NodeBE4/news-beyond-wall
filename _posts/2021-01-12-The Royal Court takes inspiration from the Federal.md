More than most businesses, theatre depends on getting bodies into buildings. Livestreamed digital performances are a poor substitute, and socially distanced productions are the worst of both worlds: busy enough that every cough in the audience sets the teeth on edge, but too empty to hear ripples of laughter or collective gasps of shock. In Britain, successive lockdowns have ruled out even those attenuated forms of drama. </p><p >The loss is significant. Especially at moments of crisis, theatrical storytelling allows societies to process events collectively. The “purpose of playing,” as William Shakespeare put it, is to “hold the mirror up to nature”. That is not to mention the extensive ecosystem of actors, writers, designers, stage managers, technicians and choreographers who have been left out of a job. <a href="https://www.economist.com/prospero/2020/06/22/covid-19-is-an-existential-threat-to-britains-theatres">Many are freelancers</a> without access to the pandemic relief funds doled out to institutions.</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p >In response to this predicament, the Royal Court has turned to an American precedent for inspiration: the Federal Theatre Project (FTP), a programme of stage and radio plays set up during the Depression of the 1930s as part of the New Deal. The causes of theatre’s problems were different back then. Economic disaster brought to a head decades of artistic stagnation, partly caused by the need to compete with cheap movies and radio. Directors were paralysed, self-defeatingly clinging to tired formats with dwindling appeal, such as vaudeville. Yet the resulting problems were familiar: lots of unemployed theatre workers and the diminishment of cultural life.</p><p >The FTP was designed to solve the first of these problems. It was explicitly a relief measure, never aiming at commercial success; tickets to two-thirds of its productions were free. But it ended up tackling the second issue, too. The FTP drew on the talents of Orson Welles, Marlon Brando and Arthur Miller, staging forward-thinking productions influenced by the European avant-garde. Its plays squarely addressed the issues of the day, often in the form of openly political left-wing invective. “Living Newspapers”, from which the new Royal Court show takes direct inspiration, adapted newspaper clippings about unequal housing or agricultural policy into polemical drama, informing audiences and critiquing those in power. </p><p >The FTP also stridently pushed for racial equality and diversity, funding branches for black theatre-makers and kicking out managers who attempted to segregate workers. For its trouble—and despite considerable critical success—the FTP was defunded in 1939 by the Un-American Activities Committee of the House of Representatives, on the grounds that it promoted racial integration and a communist agenda.</p><figure><div itemscope="" itemProp="image" itemType="https://schema.org/ImageObject" data-slim="0"><meta itemProp="url" content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/720/90/sites/default/files/images/2021/01/blogs/prospero/20210116_bkp505.jpg"/><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/720/90/sites/default/files/images/2021/01/blogs/prospero/20210116_bkp505.jpg"  sizes="(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw" alt=""/></div></figure><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p >The Royal Court’s “Living Newspaper” is not on the same scale as the FTP’s, which cost $46m at the time—hundreds of millions in present-day terms. But its stated aims are consistent with its predecessor: “to give as many people as possible work, to bring our theatre back to life and to create something which is urgent, dynamic, political and disruptive”. The theatre estimates that more than 200 freelance artists will work on the programme. Made up of sketches, monologues, installations and dance sequences staged around the Royal Court’s building in Sloane Square, the “Living Newspaper” was meant to be created and performed weekly, before the latest lockdown paused the schedule. </p><p >The second edition, recorded and streamed online, upholds the tradition of racial inclusivity in its diverse cast and writers, as well as in its content. One playlet features Cantonese aunties teaching protest strategies developed on the streets of Hong Kong; another rails against lurid media coverage of police violence against black people. As for political invective, the opening performance is a grime protest song by Jammz, a rapper, who is accompanied by singers belting out a chorus riff of “Tory scum”. Regrettably, despite targeting everything from ambulance waiting times to the mendacity of Brexit campaigners (hardly a hot-off-the-press political issue), the song fails to land truly meaningful blows. Instead, with the closing shouts of “you will not survive the revolution!” it comes to feel a bit silly.</p><p >Vastly more successful are the scenes which approach politics obliquely. The best is a monologue by Emteaz Hussain, a playwright, told from the perspective of a newly homeless mother of young children. The drudgery of grinding poverty is laid bare: tortuous household calculations over tins of beans or nappies and rehearsals of times-tables in cramped emergency accommodation. A monologue directly addressing the audience isn’t a new theatrical format. But in the hands of a talented writer, it can still be an extraordinarily powerful one. </p><p ><em>The first two editions of “Living Newspaper: A Counter Narrative” had their premiere in December 2020. The project will continue after the current national lockdown</em></p>
