At least when it comes to natural ones. On May 4th Pandora became the first big jeweller to announce that it will no longer sell mined diamonds. Instead it will use gems made in a laboratory. Even mining companies are getting in on the act. In 2018 <a href="https://www.economist.com/international/2017/02/25/a-report-from-de-beerss-new-diamond-mine">De Beers</a>, the world’s largest miner of diamonds by value, launched a brand called Lightbox to sell jewellery featuring the synthetic stones. But how are these gemstones different from the ones found underground? And how can they be replicated in a lab?</p><p >Natural diamonds were formed more than 1bn years ago deep below cratons, the oldest parts of continents. There, between the planet’s core and its crust, the pressure and temperature were just right to crystallise carbon into its hardest form. Diamonds would have remained there were it not for molten rock rushing through the mantle, drawing them up towards the Earth’s surface. This provided the deposits that firms such as De Beers mine today. But in the 1950s General Electric, an American industrial conglomerate, developed a process to make diamonds by artificially crystallising carbon under ten gigapascals of pressure—equivalent to the weight of 64 African elephants placed on the point of a ballet dancer’s shoe—and temperatures above 2,000°C. This process was enormously expensive and energy inefficient. And until recently the stones produced were too unrefined, too uniform in colour and sometimes too unattractively yellow (because of excess nitrogen in their chemistry) to make attractive jewellery. The main uses for lab-grown diamonds are industrial, where they are valued for their strength, for instance as the tips of heavy-duty drills. </p><p ><iframe height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/s1h4gze_ktk?enablejsapi=1"></iframe></p><p >But now scientists have developed processes that can create synthetic diamonds at a fraction of the cost and time it took in the 1950s—and they look more like the real thing, too. Pandora’s new collection of lab-grown diamond jewellery will be produced using “chemical-vapour deposition” (CVD), a technique commonly used in the production of semiconductors. In a plasma reactor as hot as the sun, atomised gases produce carbon atoms that attach to the crystal lattice of a natural-diamond seed, known as a substrate, forming a new diamond good enough to set in a ring. On average it costs $300 to $500 per carat (equivalent to 200 milligrams) to produce a diamond by CVD, according to a report in 2018 by Bain, a consultancy. That is ten times cheaper than a decade earlier. And, in 2020, they cost shoppers about a third less than a mined stone. </p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p >Jewellers hope that their lab-grown wares will help <a href="https://www.economist.com/leaders/2017/02/23/the-waning-power-of-the-engagement-ring">revive flagging sales</a> of diamonds. Production of real ones has fallen by more than a quarter since 2017, according to Bain, to 111m carats last year. Demand has been hit in part because of worries about ethical sourcing. “Blood Diamond”, a film from 2006 starring Leonardo DiCaprio, highlighted how the diamond trade helps to fund criminal and rebel groups in Africa. Lab-grown diamonds provide a morally acceptable—and cheaper—alternative. Even so, until synthetic diamonds become truly cheap, there remain less noble reasons to avoid buying a pricey ring. Given the recessions caused by the covid-19 pandemic, newly engaged couples may prefer to spend their money on something less frivolous than a rock, no matter how it was produced.</p>
