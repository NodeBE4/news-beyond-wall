At the mid-point of this line would be Chad, a powderkeg surrounded by blazes. (Its neighbours include strife-torn Libya, Sudan and the Central African Republic.) <a href="https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2021/04/22/chads-strongman-president-idriss-deby-is-killed-by-rebels" data-tegid="d7lotv6eqvi27s0hu2qnanqooogd9vdh">President Idriss Déby</a>, the soldier who ran it for the past 30 years, has prevented Chad from exploding. But now he is dead. On April 20th the army said he had died of wounds sustained in battle. He was personally leading his troops against rebels who were heading for the capital, N’Djamena. His passing, and a subsequent military coup by his son, have cast a shadow over the region, and over France’s policy of propping up African strongmen.</p><p >Instead of handing power to the leader of parliament, as required by the constitution, the army put in place a military council headed by Mr Déby’s 37-year-old son, Mahamat Idriss Déby (pictured). The African Union, which is supposed to have a “no coup” policy, uttered barely a murmur. France, Chad’s main Western ally, turned a blind eye, too.</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p >Chad hosts a large French army base and the headquarters of Operation Barkhane, an effort to fight jihadists in the Sahel involving 5,100 French troops. Its small army punches well above its weight. During the cold war, Chadian troops driving Toyota pickup trucks repelled the tanks of Muammar Qaddafi, a Soviet-backed Libyan dictator. In 2015, after the jihadists of Boko Haram had overrun north-eastern Nigeria, it was Chad’s turbaned warriors who ejected them from the main towns. This year, when France was searching for allies in its fight against Islamic State and other jihadist groups in the Sahel, it was Chad that answered the call, sending 1,200 battle-hardened fighters into the border area between Niger, Mali and Burkina Faso.</p><p >Chad’s previous dictator, Hissène Habré, was especially brutal. He seized power in 1982, after a Western-backed rebellion, and ruled for eight years. He is said to have ordered the deaths of 40,000 of his people. Many died in an underground prison known as <em>La Piscine</em>, a converted underground swimming pool where inmates were tortured, raped and beaten to death. However, America appreciated his help holding back the red menace. Ronald Reagan welcomed Habré to the White House and praised his “commitment to freedom”.</p><p >Mr Déby overthrew Habré. Under him, the secret police committed fewer atrocities, but did not stop entirely. Plenty of his opponents were tortured or murdered, and elections were skilfully rigged in his favour. None of this seemed to affect the support he enjoyed from France, which bombed rebels for him in 2019. After his death the French government said it had lost “a courageous friend”. Far from condemning the illegal transfer of power to the junior Déby, French officials expressed their “strong attachment to Chad’s stability”. Nigeria’s government agreed. “The immediate objective is the stabilisation of Chad,” it said, adding that democracy was “an ultimate goal”.</p><p >This is short-sighted. It is the constant deferral of democracy that has brought Chad to its current sorry state. It is fighting rebels, who are now thought to be less than 300km from the capital. Analysts fear the army will splinter, leading to civil war. Some liken Chad to Libya, which collapsed into carnage after the death of Qaddafi. Instead of backing the next dictator, Chad’s friends should be pushing for talks between the government, rebels and, crucially, the civilian opposition and for a quick restoration of the constitution followed by clean elections. <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p><p data-test-id="Footnote" >This article appeared in the Leaders section of the print edition under the headline &quot;The false promise of stability&quot;</p>
