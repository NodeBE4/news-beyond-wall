The results of this census are used for many purposes, among the most important of which is allocating congressional representatives proportionally to the population in each state. Because Congress fixed the number of seats in the House of Representatives at 435 in 1929, the Census Bureau has to shuffle seats between states as their populations grow and shrink.</p><figure><div itemscope="" itemProp="image" itemType="https://schema.org/ImageObject" data-slim="0"><meta itemProp="url" content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/993/90/sites/default/files/images/2021/04/blogs/economist-explains/20210501_wom983.png"/><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/993/90/sites/default/files/images/2021/04/blogs/economist-explains/20210501_wom983.png"  sizes="(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw" alt=""/></div></figure><p >On April 26th the Bureau released its estimates for the next decade. They show a shifting of political power as southern and western states have grown at higher rates than northern ones. According to the new tallies, which took over a year to complete and were delayed because of the covid-19 pandemic, California, Illinois, Michigan, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia will each lose one House member for the next Congress. (California’s loss is its first ever; its population has grown more slowly than that of other states.) Colorado, Florida, Montana, North Carolina and Oregon will each gain one, while Texas will gain two (see map).</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p >It will take months more before states redraw their individual Congressional plans to determine which areas will gain or lose districts. That is because the fine-grained data that enumerate populations at the neighbourhood level, which redistricting committees need to run their incredibly precise districting software, will not be released by the Census Bureau until the autumn. Those counts take much longer to finalise than the aggregated state-level estimates.</p><p >Once the Census Bureau sends states their data, the race to redraw districts begins. Many states face legal requirements to finish the redistricting in a matter of months. Idaho, for example, gives the independent redistricting commission only 90 days to draw and agree on new maps. It is one of seven states that use a non-partisan commission of citizens, usually chosen by courts, the state auditor or the legislature, to draw district borders. As of 2021 Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Michigan, Montana and Oregon are the only states that let citizens, with inputs from experts and their legislatures, decide how maps get drawn. Ten others delegate the redistricting process to citizen commissions with a partisan imbalance, commissions made up of elected officials, independent boards that only get a say if the legislature can’t pick a map, or other appointed staff. The rest leave the process up to the state legislatures, which are much more <a href="https://www.economist.com/united-states/2021/03/13/how-the-2020-census-may-help-republicans-regain-power-in-washington">likely to draw districts that are biased</a> towards one party or against a minority racial group—known as “gerrymandering”—despite some having constitutional standards against partisan bias.</p><p >Until 2013, Section 5 of the 1965 Voting Rights Act required jurisdictions with a history of racial discrimination or segregation to receive approval for proposed districting plans from the Department of Justice before implementing them, a process known as preclearance. In 2011, that requirement applied to nine whole states—all but one were Southern—and smaller portions of six others. But in 2013 the Supreme Court said the formula that had identified states plagued by racial bias was based on old data. In Shelby County v Holder, the court invalidated the coverage formula, putting Section 5 out of service unless Congress creates a new one, which it has not yet done.</p><p >Because census results were delayed, most states will have to rush their redistricting processes to meet deadlines for the 2022 elections. The lack of preclearance will give states greater leeway in drawing maps, though racially biased ones can still be challenged in court and subsequently adjusted. But however districts are ultimately apportioned within states, the next Congress will reflect America’s continuing population shift southward and westward.</p><br><hr><div>获取更多RSS：<br><a href="https://feedx.net" style="color:orange" target="_blank">https://feedx.net</a> <br><a href="https://feedx.top" style="color:orange" target="_blank">https://feedx.top</a><br></div>
