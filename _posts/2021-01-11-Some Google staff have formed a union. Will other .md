So, too, has the rise of the tech giants whose huge profit margins and soaring share prices threaten to concentrate wealth in the hands of a few rich shareholders. And so the news, on January 4th, that employees at Alphabet, the parent company of Google, have formed a trade union—a rarity at tech firms in Silicon Valley—was greeted warmly by many inequality-watchers. But whether unionisation in Silicon Valley will catch on, or will make much of a difference if it does, is questionable.</p><p >Unionisation has so far made few inroads into most Silicon Valley firms. According to America’s Bureau of Labour Statistics, just 4.9% of the country’s 5.1m workers employed in “computer and mathematical” occupations—including software developers, programmers and systems analysts—were represented by unions in 2019 (see chart). This figure has remained flat for decades. Today only people involved in food preparation, sales and agriculture are less likely than Silicon Valley’s IT workers to have union representation.</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p >This is not surprising. The Valley’s coders and other office workers are well paid and enjoy perks such as free meals that most workers can only dream of. They also possess highly sought-after skills, so they can easily find work elsewhere if they chafe at their lot. Meanwhile, most lower-skilled jobs, such as work in the canteens that produce those free lunches, have been outsourced, meaning that the workers are ineligible under American law for collective-bargaining rights.</p><p >Nevertheless, the founders of the Alphabet Workers Union say the company provides fertile ground for a new union, claiming the company’s executives think that “discrimination” and an “unethical working environment are working as intended, at the cost of workers with less institutional power”. They also claim that organised labour has already had some success at the firm. Alphabet’s practice of forcing its direct employees to use arbitration for claims of sexual harassment was ended after a strike in November 2018. And employee pressure, they claim, forced Alphabet to drop the company’s artificial-intelligence programme with America’s armed forces, as well as Project Dragonfly, a plan to launch a search engine in China that would be subject to Chinese-government censorship.</p><p >The thought of growing unionisation in tech may excite some on the left. Some researchers have put forward the idea that the decline of unions is responsible for the drop in the “labour share”—the proportion of GDP accruing to workers in the form of pay and benefits—and the rising “capital share”, which accrues to shareholders. Higher levels of union membership could increase the workers’ share of output and therefore reduce inequality. However, the empirical evidence on this is mixed. Recent research by the Bank of England has found that a rise of ten percentage points in the rate of unionisation increases wage growth by around 0.25 percentage points a year. In other words, by not very much. Another paper by the Brookings Institution, a think-tank, finds only a weak relationship between unionisation and labour’s share of national income. Other economists suggest that widening profit margins, the result of shrinking competition in American product markets, may be a more important factor behind capital’s rising share of income.</p><p >Moreover, the Alphabet Workers Union may well be an exception rather than the start of a trend. Although the new group announced its plans, to great fanfare, in an opinion piece in the New York Times, so far the group includes just 226 of Alphabet’s 140,000 employees, or less than 0.2%. Nor is the group immediately seeking ratification from America’s union regulator, the National Labour Relations Board, meaning that its members will have to wait to receive any collective-bargaining rights.</p><p >And contrary to widespread hopes that technology could encourage unionisation—by making it easier for Google’s software contractors, Uber’s drivers, or Deliveroo’s cyclists to contact each other to organise, for instance—there is, so far, little evidence for this.</p>
