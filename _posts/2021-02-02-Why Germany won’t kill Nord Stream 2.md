A flotilla of Russian boats, stripped of the usual international service and logistics support, is trying to complete the construction of Nord Stream 2 (NS2), a 1,230-km (765-mile) gas pipeline that would double capacity from Russia to Germany. Less than 150km remain to be built, mainly in Danish waters. Meanwhile the American government, armed with ever-growing secondary-sanctions legislation, is watching closely, picking off companies it suspects of involvement in the construction of NS2. The pipeline’s fate depends on the outcome of this race.</p><p >NS2 has inspired fierce criticism ever since 2015, when Gazprom, Russia’s state-backed gas giant, and five European energy giants formed a €9.5bn ($11bn) consortium to lay a new pipeline next to an existing one along the Baltic seabed. American opposition to NS2, grounded in concerns that it will expand the malign influence of the Kremlin, is a rare bipartisan affair. Many Europeans, especially in the east, fear it will increase the EU’s dependence on Russian energy—and harm Ukraine by depriving it of the transit fees it earns from an existing pipeline. France reiterated its opposition this week. The European Commission, which over the years has successfully reined in Gazprom’s ambitions in Europe, is sceptical, and the European Parliament is vehemently opposed. Many Germans who value these opinions wonder why their government insists on ploughing ahead.</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-1"></div></div></div><div ><figure><div itemscope="" itemProp="image" itemType="https://schema.org/ImageObject" data-slim="1"><meta itemProp="url" content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/662/90/sites/default/files/20210206_EUM979.png"/><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/662/90/sites/default/files/20210206_EUM979.png"  sizes="300px" alt=""/></div></figure><p >Yet plough on it does. Ministers briefly flirted with the idea of cancelling NS2 after the poisoning of Alexei Navalny, a Russian dissident, last August, but quickly reverted to type. Challenged after Mr Navalny’s recent detention in Moscow, Angela Merkel, Germany’s chancellor, said she had not changed her mind on NS2, and noted that America remains happy to buy Russian oil. To circumvent American sanctions, the government of Mecklenburg-West Pomerania, a sparsely populated state in north-east Germany where the pipeline makes landfall, has even established a foundation, mainly funded by Gazprom, to serve as an intermediary between NS2 and contracting companies—all in the name, risibly, of “climate protection”. (Genuine climate activists are appalled.)</p></div><p >That attempt looks doomed to fail. And America’s persistent efforts to kill NS2 are bearing fruit. Congress has passed two sets of sanctions targeting the pipeline; the scope of both has been expanded in the past seven months. In December 2019 the mere threat of sanctions forced Allseas, a Swiss undersea construction firm, to pull its vessels from the project, halting construction for a year and costing Gazprom hundreds of millions. Many other companies, from engineering firms to reinsurers, have been scared off.</p><p >Construction restarted in December. Yet the heat continues to rise. On January 19th, the last full day of the Trump administration, the American government applied sanctions on Fortuna, a Russian vessel repurposed for pipe-laying. A few weeks earlier Congress approved an amendment to a different set of sanctions passed in 2019. By radically expanding the set of companies now exposed to American action to include insurers, certifiers and any other entity supporting “pipe-laying activities”, the new legislation may prove a “game-changer,” says Mateusz Kubiak, an analyst at Esperis, a consultancy based in Warsaw. With delays and more expense, Russia may eventually be able to conclude the pipe-laying and technical work itself, he says. But certification, a technical exercise designed to show that the pipeline meets international safety and design standards, “cannot be simply transferred to some murky Russian company”.</p><p >Time is another issue. Even with the fairest of winds Russia will struggle to complete all the work, including certification, before Germany’s general election on September 26th. That vote could bring Germany’s Greens, who vociferously oppose NS2, into government alongside Mrs Merkel’s Christian Democrats, now led by Armin Laschet, a supporter. The pipeline could become a bone of contention during coalition talks. “I’d advise Mr Laschet to avoid joining the Putin/Nord Stream 2 fan club if he wants a coalition with us,” says Cem Özdemir, a senior Green who is sometimes tipped to be foreign minister.</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p >The aggressive sanctions policy of the Trump administration unsettled even stalwart foes of NS2 in Europe (and made life difficult for the likes of Mr Özdemir). Mr Biden will certainly tread more softly. But he opposed NS2 as Barack Obama’s vice-president, and last week his spokeswoman called it a “bad deal for Europe”, while adding that the new administration was still reviewing the relevant laws. Still, as Dan Fried, a sanctions co-ordinator at the State department in the Obama administration, notes, the final text of the new legislation slightly lowers the bar for the president to waive them. “It’s a hint that Congress wants a deal.”</p><p >What might that look like? One proposal is an automatic mechanism to impose sanctions on Gazprom should the Kremlin renege on a five-year deal brokered by Mrs Merkel in 2019 to keep gas flowing across Ukraine. Another is a grand bargain in which America would drop its sanctions in exchange for broader German commitments to bolster energy security in eastern Europe. The delays caused by the sanctions open space for negotiations. Yet so far the German government has shown little interest. “It’s not just for the US to come asking Germany for a deal; Germany has to want to play too,” says Mr Fried.</p><p >Some still hope for a change of heart in the chancellery. “It is not too late to give up the project,” says Andrzej Przylebski, Poland’s ambassador to Germany. But Mrs Merkel may not shed too many tears if America scuppers the project, argues Sarah Pagung at the German Council on Foreign Relations in Berlin. NS2 has become Germany’s biggest foreign-policy headache. Death-by-sanctions would ease the pain without an obligation to accept the blame, and probably save the German government from vast compensation bills. It would be an ignoble end for an ignoble project.</p>
