The irksome upstart who had to be neutralised was Thomas Becket, Archbishop of Canterbury. “Will no one rid me of this troublesome priest?” Henry snapped in 1170, or words to that effect. His oblique command was to become a proverbial case of gangsterism dressed in plausible deniability.</p><p >The shocking murder that resulted is at the heart of a new exhibition at the British Museum, its first to open since the pandemic struck last year. A replica altar occupies an otherwise empty space. Menacing music accompanies an audiovisual re-enactment. Four knights who take up Henry’s hint (or challenge) seem to cast long shadows on the walls; monks chant dolefully in Latin; a bell tolls. And the blood of the king’s erstwhile friend and lord chancellor splatters the wall like poppy petals.</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p >As the many eyewitness accounts attest, the reality was far ghastlier—heavy medieval armour clanging against the cold flagstones of Canterbury Cathedral as the crowd shrank back, the shouts of a cornered man, a sword-swipe that sliced off the top of Becket’s head as if it were a boiled egg. Later, when the monks finally undressed the corpse, beneath his fine vestments he was found to have worn a hair shirt crawling with vermin. After spending six years in exile in France Becket had returned to England, not just to speak truth to power and defend the church’s privileges against the monarchy’s encroachments, but to offer his life up to God.</p><p >“It’s no overstatement to say that Becket’s murder was the crime of the century, and one of the most notorious events of the entire medieval period,” says Naomi Speakman, one of the curators. Recognising his martyrdom, onlookers dipped their cloaks in the blood. News of his death quickly reached the king—and the pope. Becket had been “a real mover and shaker across Europe”, says Ms Speakman, and his bones were carried across the continent in jewelled reliquaries, examples of which are on display in the show. It brings home how enmeshed medieval England was with the European mainland. Like Becket, Henry had French ancestry; he ruled more French territory than the French king did.</p><p >Eagerly repeated stories of people being cured after drinking “Thomas’s water”, an essence of blood so diluted it was hardly pink, led quickly to calls for Becket’s canonisation and the birth of a cult. Three years after his murder, he was made a saint. For Henry, amid all that, there was no forgiveness—however much he insisted that he had not intended Becket’s death. A 12th-century baptismal font, still in use in a small church in southern Sweden, shows Becket kneeling in prayer as the knights fall upon him. A crowned man encouraging the violence is labelled <small>REX.HRICVS</small>.</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p >If the king’s offhand thuggery became an archetype, so did his belated fear: fear of the man who will not be cowed. Three and a half centuries after Becket’s demise, Henry VIII was so wary of his cult’s power that he had it suppressed by Thomas Cromwell—like Becket, a commoner elevated by a monarch’s caprice, then destroyed by it. In Martin Luther King, Archbishop Óscar Romero (killed as he celebrated mass in San Salvador in 1980) and perhaps, today, Alexei Navalny, Becket’s steadfastness in the face of death found modern avatars too. That dual legacy makes the story recounted in this show enduringly gripping. <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p><p ><em>“Thomas Becket: Murder and the Making of a Saint” is at the British Museum from May 20th until August 22nd</em></p><p data-test-id="Footnote" >This article appeared in the Books &amp; arts section of the print edition under the headline &quot;Murder in the cathedral&quot;</p>
