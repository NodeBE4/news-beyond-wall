When the three musicians (pictured) recorded their barbaric yawp in a low-fi studio in Wallsend, outside Newcastle-upon-Tyne, they proved incompetent. Anthony “Abaddon” Bray, the drummer, did not realise the snare was the most important part of his kit and ignored it entirely, pounding out a rhythm on the toms. That very amateurism, combined with the poor recording equipment, meant “In League With Satan” sounded like no metal record that had come before it. From that track sprang all the metal variants that are grouped under the heading “extreme metal”. By not knowing what they were doing, Venom had inadvertently invented a genre.</p><p >Rock and pop are replete with styles that came about as the result of happenstance. Metal alone has undergone at least two other significant evolutions by accident. The first was in 1964 when Dave Davies of The Kinks inadvertently invented a distorted guitar sound by taking a razor blade to the speaker cone of his amplifier in frustration: the damaged speaker made his guitar suddenly sound unhinged. A few years later Black Sabbath’s lead guitarist, Tony Iommi, lost two fingertips on his right hand in an industrial accident. To continue playing, he shaped false tips out of plastic, but found he struggled to bend the strings. Only by downtuning his guitar to make the strings loose could he manipulate them, and so the ominous, deep sound that bands still produce today was invented.</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p >The invention of dub music in Jamaica in the late 1960s was an accident, too—the result of human error. A studio engineer forgot to add the vocal track to a mix that King Tubby, another engineer, was assembling. When the instrumental version was played at a dance the next weekend, the crowd loved it. Bunny Lee, a reggae producer, later recalled telling King Tubby about the reaction of the partygoers: “‘Tubbs the mistake we made was a serious joke. It mash up Spanish Town! The people went wild...It played about 20 times.” Forty years earlier, Louis Armstrong popularised scat singing when he dropped the sheet music while recording the song “Heebie Jeebies”. So as not to waste tape, he carried on singing nonsense syllables. That was the take that was released.</p><p >When new technology has forged genres, it has not always been by design. Hip-hop would have been impossible without the Technics SL-1200 turntable. Rather than being propelled by a belt, it used a motor and so reached playing speed almost immediately. This made the techniques employed by hip-hop DJs, such as scratching, possible. The pitch-control slider allowed DJs to slow down or speed up records, too, which made beat-matching feasible; different records could be bled seamlessly into one another. None of that had been foreseen by the turntable’s designer, Shuichi Obata.</p><p >Hip-hop and electronic dance music owed further leaps to a technological mistake: the distinctive “sizzling” sound of the Roland TR-808 drum machine—the foundational sound of electronic music in the 1980s—came from a defective transistor. Once transistor manufacturing standards improved, the imperfect ones disappeared and Roland could no longer find them. In 1983, because there were no faulty transistors left, Roland had to stop building the TR-808, after a run of just 12,000.</p><p >Music aficionados often complain that there’s nowhere left for rock and pop to go. They need only wait for the next time a musician doesn’t know what they’re doing and, by mistake, makes a breakthrough. Perhaps right now, someone in a factory somewhere is putting faulty wiring into a computer and, somewhere down the line, someone else will realise that glitch will make a sound no one has heard before. A new style of music will be born.</p>
