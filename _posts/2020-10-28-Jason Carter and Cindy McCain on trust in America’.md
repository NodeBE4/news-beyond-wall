The South American country’s troubles may sound familiar to Americans: allegations of voter suppression and intimidation, fraudulent ballots, ballot boxes going missing or being destroyed, attempts to thwart the count and fears that the party in power would not accept the results if it lost.</p><p >The situation was resolved only after tense litigation and a recount. A Guyanese attorney and election observer, when asked her advice to Americans, replied bluntly: “Protect your process. You have the greatest democracy in the world. But if it loses credibility, it is very hard to get that credibility back.”<br/><br/>Americans are worried about this year’s election and the rest of the world is looking on anxiously. Problems with elections bedevil many countries. Indeed, in the more than 100 elections that the Carter Centre has observed—and the dozens we ourselves watched over—there has never been a perfect one. But that does not necessarily invalidate them. In America, too, the challenges do not fundamentally threaten democracy.</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p >We write this together, as a traditional Democrat and Republican, to stress the integrity of America’s election operations and its non-partisan nature. The best way for Americans to “protect the process” is to recognise that the foundations of the voting system remain strong. Americans, and the world, can have confidence in the outcome.</p><p >We appreciate that for some people—on both sides of the political spectrum—this may be a controversial statement. They believe that the election is being tampered with or rigged to favour one side.</p><p >To be sure, America faces overarching problems when it comes to exercising the franchise. These include the undeniable history of racial polarisation and voter suppression; the marginalisation of minorities and other communities that often face obstacles to register and vote; partisan gerrymandering by both sides; the lack of a central, independent electoral administration; decreasing levels of public trust in elections; and weak campaign-finance rules that let money distort our political process. These problems must be fixed.</p><p >Still, there is a big difference between an imperfect election, even when the flaws are significant, and an election that is “stolen” and doesn’t reflect the will of the people. In a democracy like America’s—with decentralised, state control over election processes, intense scrutiny from the media and the public, and strong institutions—it is nearly impossible to steal an election without getting caught or to keep power when you have been voted out. <br/><br/>People on all sides who worry about the credibility of our election should know that irregularities are scrutinised and that there are multiple checks on the process. These include poll watchers from both political parties, independent observers, broad media coverage of exit polls and results, and robust opportunities for judicial dispute-resolution before, during and after the election. <br/><br/>These are the kinds of safeguards that prevent fraud and that make it difficult for any election irregularity to have systemic effect. Americans of every race, creed and political affiliation should understand that their votes will be handled securely and counted properly. We can be proud that, throughout our history, incumbents and challengers have always accepted the results and there have been peaceful transitions of power.</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p >Our institutions are strong. Any president seeking to maintain power in defiance of an election result would find opposition from every branch of American government, including political leaders of both parties, the judiciary and the military—yes, the military too. And no challenger could hope to usurp a credible outcome.<br/><br/>The one thing we can all agree on is that American democracy is more important than party politics. It is what ensures that we have robust party politics, after all. <br/><br/>Strikingly, the biggest threat to our democracy is not the flaws in our system, but Americans’ loss of trust in our institutions. All of us with a voice have an obligation to restore confidence, especially in the face of misinformation. This requires that all Americans, from our most senior political leaders to each citizen, be responsible when communicating election information.<br/><br/>Despite accounts of small, localised election problems and real barriers to access, we see no evidence of widespread fraud or vulnerabilities in the system. And we are heartened that our democracy has inspired people to speak out and get involved more than ever. We are on pace for the largest voter turnout in a century. This shows that people haven’t completely lost their faith in the system. <br/><br/>Some people have concerns over the mechanics of voting, particularly amid covid-19. Americans should be prepared for an increase in alternative voting methods, such as mail-in ballots, which will probably take extra time to count. That may mean there is no official winner on election night. This is not a weakness of our institutions but rather a strength: there are fair, non-partisan and transparent processes to determine a winner, even if these processes take time. <br/><br/>Elections are ultimately a report on the state of a democracy. Although we face real national challenges, Americans are pouring into the polls, our democracy is fundamentally strong and our country has all that it needs to “protect the process”.</p><hr/><p ><em>Jason Carter, a Democrat, is the chairman of the Carter Centre and grandson of President Jimmy Carter.
