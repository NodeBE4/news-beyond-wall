Forty-eight of the home’s 200-odd residents had died from covid-19. Survivors’ relatives gathered to demand that it employ more staff. A doctor said the home had mixed infected with uninfected residents and had too little oxygen to treat the sick. She described it as a war zone. A hospital took over its management. By mid-January, 74 residents had died.</p><p >The toll at Tendercare Living was an extreme example of a widespread problem. Deaths in Canada from covid-19 are about half those in the European Union as a share of population. Nearly three-quarters of the 14,000 Canadian deaths to mid-December took place in care homes. A study by the Canadian Institute for Health Information found that deaths in Canadian long-term care homes by late May were 25% higher than the average among 17 members of the <small>OECD</small>, a rich-country club, as a share of their populations. On December 31st the <em>Toronto Star</em>, Canada’s largest-circulation newspaper, published an editorial that took up the full front page decrying needless death in the long-term care system. It is “as if we have allowed [old people] to be put into coffins and buried alive before our very eyes”, the newspaper wrote.</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p >The crisis may soon subside. In Ontario, the most populous province (of which Toronto is the capital), all long-term care residents are due to be vaccinated by mid-February. But the problems highlighted by the pandemic will not disappear quickly. Canada consigns too many old folk to institutions, one reason why such a high proportion of covid-19 deaths has taken place in them. They are poorly regulated and many are badly designed. The problems will grow more pressing as the population ages. The share of Canadians older than 65 is expected to rise from a sixth to a quarter by 2041.</p><p >In its treatment of old people Canada is an “international outlier”, says a recent report by Queen’s University’s School of Policy Studies. Canada spends less than most rich countries on long-term care: 1.3% of <small>GDP</small> (including the cost of compulsory insurance) compared with 1.7% on average by members of the <small>OECD</small>. That money is skewed towards institutions such as Tendercare Living rather than towards helping people remain in their own houses. In Canada 42% of people over 80 who need constant care are in institutions, compared with an <small>OECD</small> average of 30%. Denmark, which passed a law in 1987 that effectively barred construction of collective facilities, spends less on institutions than on home care, which is much cheaper. Canada, by contrast, spends six times more on institutional care. “We don’t do [home care] well. We default to institutional care,” says Fred Horne, a former health minister of the western province of Alberta. </p><p >Canada’s institutional largesse is not well spent. In part this is because care homes, like their residents, are old. Many were built in the 1970s, when four-person wards were standard. They have shared toilets and little space for isolating sick residents. In 1998 Ontario’s government said no new homes could have four-person wards. But it has continued to issue 15-year licences to homes that have them. In March last year nearly 20,000 residents—a quarter of the total—were still in four-person wards. Canadian homes have a lower ratio of staff to residents than the <small>OECD</small> average.</p><p >One problem is that, whereas there are national standards for health care, there is no equivalent for old-age care. The provinces set standards and enforce them. Some do a poor job of quality control. Ontario used to conduct thorough annual inspections of all homes. But in 2018 its Conservative government, led by Doug Ford, began to restrict inspections mainly to facilities about which it received complaints. In the following year just nine of the province’s 626 homes had full inspections.</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p >Regulatory neglect compounds the problems to which old-age care is prone everywhere: low wages for doing a vital and demanding job, employees who quit often, and part-timers who work in several homes and get no paid sick leave.</p><p >Conditions are worse at for-profit homes, such as Tendercare, which make up more than a quarter of the total nationwide. In British Columbia, a western province, a third of homes are for-profit. They “pay lower wages, have lower staffing levels, hire more part-time and casual workers and have more [staff] turnover than non-profit homes”, notes a recent study in the <em>Canadian Medical Association Journal</em>. The non-profits are run by municipalities, churches and other charities.</p><p >Covid-19 cruelly exposed the system’s weaknesses. In March Mr Ford vowed to protect long-term care homes with an “iron ring”. But outbreaks have occurred at 41% of Ontario’s homes. During the first wave, health authorities gave top priority to limiting hospitalisations, so infected care-home residents were not sent for treatment. The homes’ links to public-health agencies and acute-care hospitals are weak, making it hard for them to get advice on how to control the disease. Eventually hospitals took control of 18 care homes in Ontario, 15 of them for-profit institutions.</p><p >Testing of residents and staff was slow in the pandemic’s early stages. Some provinces restricted workers to one residence, which forced care homes to use poorly trained workers supplied by agencies. Afraid of falling ill or being quarantined, some staff stopped coming to work, creating a shortage. In April Quebec, the French-speaking province, asked for 1,000 soldiers to help in long-term care homes. It guaranteed training to any person who applied and full-time jobs to those who completed it. This has eased staff shortages.</p><p >The covid-19 catastrophe may prompt reforms. A study by the Royal Society of Canada, an organisation of scholars, calls for more surprise inspections of care homes, with fines and penalties for non-compliance. The federal government, led by the Liberal Party, wants to replace provincial standards with national ones. It has offered provinces C$1bn ($790m) over two years, about 2% of the total spending on long-term care, for extra staff and to control disease outbreaks.</p><p >The government’s ideas may not be ambitious enough. “The way this is being tossed around doesn’t suggest any big re-think at a government level,” says Mr Horne. Spending on care for old folk will have to triple, to 4.2% of <small>GDP</small>, unless Canada finds ways to keep more of them at home. “I can’t ever imagine a government or a private sector building as many facilities as we will need,” says Don Drummond of Queen’s University. “That will be a good thing if it forces us to do alternatives.” Covid-19 has sounded an alarm. A shortage of cash may cause politicians to heed it.<span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p><p ><em>Editor’s note: Some of our covid-19 coverage is free for readers of </em>The Economist Today<em>, our daily <a href="https://www.economist.comhttps://my.economist.com/user#newsletter">newsletter</a>.
