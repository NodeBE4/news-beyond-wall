Nationalist propagandists have gone further, claiming that the Basques form an ancient and superior race, the first Europeans. In some versions they descend directly from the biblical Noah.</p><p >A new study of the genes of Basques and their neighbours brings mixed news for nationalists. The study, by a team at Pompeu Fabra University in Barcelona and published in <em>Current Biology</em>, shows that Basques are indeed genetically different from their neighbours. But those differences seem to be relatively recent, dating from the end of the Iron Age (around 2,500 years ago). And they are greater in the core Basque-speaking areas than in the Basque periphery.</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p >A key finding is that Basques and other Spaniards all descend from the same Stone Age migrants from Europe’s eastern steppes. The ancient Iberians, too, spoke a non-Indo-European language (like Basque, Finnish and Hungarian). The differences only began when the Romans turned up in Iberia. Recent research has found evidence that, contrary to myth, the Romans did conquer the Basque Country. But few seem to have settled in the core Basque-speaking areas. And the Arab-Berber invaders who occupied much of Iberia for seven centuries scarcely got there. Impenetrable mountains and an incomprehensible language discouraged genetic mingling, the researchers surmise.</p><p >These findings should scotch the idea of a separate Basque race, as asserted by Sabino Arana, the founder of the Basque Nationalist Party (<small>PNV</small>). Arana was an anti-Semite who proclaimed the racial and religious purity of the Basques. When industrialisation brought a flood of migrants from the rest of the country, he warned against “the rubbing shoulders of our children with the children of the Spanish nation”.</p><p >The Basque language, a clutch of dialects that were codified in 1968, has replaced race as the focus of Basque nationalism. The <small>PNV</small>, which has successfully governed the autonomous Basque region for most of the past 40 years, vigorously supports the language. Having long distanced itself from Arana, it is a broadly Christian democratic party. But all nationalists, including the former terrorists of <small>ETA</small>, might usefully acknowledge that Basques have much in common with other Spaniards.</p><p data-test-id="Footnote" >This article appeared in the Europe section of the print edition under the headline &quot;Yes, Basques are different&quot;</p>
