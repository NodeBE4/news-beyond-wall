Underlining the disarray in the <small>EU</small>’s inoculation programme, Austria’s chancellor, Sebastian Kurz, threatened to try to stop the bloc from buying an extra 100m doses of Pfizer’s jab if his country did not get a bigger share. He has begun talks with Russia to buy vaccine. <strong>Britain</strong>, meanwhile, said a domestic factory would produce the new Novavax vaccine, which will reduce the country’s reliance on overseas production.</p><p >Despite surging infections <strong>Germany</strong> recommended that the AstraZeneca jab should be used mostly for the over-60s and limited among younger groups, because of concerns about blood-clotting. Angela Merkel said the country’s inoculation campaign “rests on the principle of trust”. The European Medicines Agency and the <small>WHO</small> continue to recommend the vaccine.</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p >Talks to form a new <strong>Dutch government</strong> broke down after one of the negotiators tested positive for covid-19 and, while rushing to leave, was photographed displaying confidential notes.</p><p >A commission in Britain that was created after last year’s Black Lives Matter protests to investigate<strong> racial disparities</strong> concluded that race is less important than social class and family structure in explaining inequality. On schooling, the report found that most children from ethnic-minority groups did as well or better than their white peers. It added that the catch-all term <small>BAME</small> (black, Asian and minority ethnic) was not very useful. The report contradicted the claims of critical race theorists, some of whom claim that white privilege is the prime cause of most disparities.</p><p >Civil-rights groups lodged lawsuits against a new <strong>voting law</strong> in Georgia, claiming that its aim is to suppress turnout among black voters. The law’s supporters say the measures, such as new voter-identification requirements, are meant to streamline procedures.</p><p ><strong>New York’s</strong> state legislature passed a bill to legalise recreational marijuana, imposing a 13% sales tax on the drug for personal use.</p><p ><strong>China</strong> and<strong> Iran</strong> signed a 25-year partnership agreement. Details of the deal were not disclosed, but an earlier version included co-operation in areas such as energy, nuclear power and weapons development. The agreement brings Iran into China’s Belt and Road Initiative.</p><p >The authorities in <strong>Libya</strong> intercepted nearly 1,000 Europe-bound migrants at sea, said the <small>UN</small>. That brings the number of people brought back to Libya this year to around 5,000, many of whom are being detained in appalling conditions.</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p >Jihadists fought the army in <strong>Mozambique</strong> for control of Palma, a hub for firms working on offshore gas projects. They killed dozens of people; witnesses reported seeing beheaded bodies in the streets. Thousands of survivors fled on boats to the provincial capital, Pemba. America accuses the rebels of links to Islamic State; others think they are driven largely by local grievances.</p><p >The police in<strong> Tanzania </strong>said 45 people died in a stampede during a public viewing of the body of John Magufuli, the late president. Mr Magufuli, who fought covid-19 with quackery, was given a hero’s burial. Many believe he died of the virus.</p><p ><strong>Myanmar’s</strong> army continued its brutal campaign to crush demonstrations against a military coup. More than 100 people were killed on March 27th, the holiday on which, in a grotesque irony, Myanmar celebrates the armed forces’ contribution to the country. That has brought the death toll since the coup to above 500.</p><p ><strong>Australia’s</strong> prime minister demoted two politicians caught up in sex scandals. Christian Porter, the attorney-general, had been accused of rape when a teenager; he denies it. Linda Reynolds, the defence minister, had called a former member of staff who claimed to have been raped in parliament “a lying cow”.</p><p ><strong>Brazil’s</strong> president, Jair Bolsonaro, replaced six key government ministers, including General Fernando Azevedo e Silva as minister of defence. General Azevedo had resisted Mr Bolsonaro’s push for the army to participate in government affairs. In an unprecedented move, all three commanders of Brazil’s armed forces quit to show solidarity with the general, plunging the Bolsonaro government into a crisis. Deaths from covid-19, meanwhile, hit a new daily record.</p><p >China’s parliament approved changes to <strong>Hong Kong’s</strong> electoral system. In future, candidates for the territory’s Legislative Council will need nominations from the Election Committee, a body stacked with backers of China’s Communist Party. Forty of the seats will now be filled by the committee. All candidates for election to public office will be vetted: those deemed unpatriotic will be struck off the list.</p><p >Experts from China and the <small>WHO</small> issued a report on their investigation into the <strong>origins of covid-19</strong>. It said the virus most probably jumped from animals to humans through an intermediate animal host, and that it was “extremely unlikely” that it had escaped from a Chinese laboratory.</p><h2>Coronavirus briefs</h2><h2><figure><div itemscope="" itemProp="image" itemType="https://schema.org/ImageObject" data-slim="1"><meta itemProp="url" content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/1451/90/sites/default/files/images/print-edition/20210403_WWC053.png"/><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/1451/90/sites/default/files/images/print-edition/20210403_WWC053.png"  sizes="300px" alt=""/></div></figure></h2><p >The leaders of two dozen countries, including Britain, France and Germany, called for a new <strong>global treaty</strong> to fight pandemics. The declaration described covid-19 as “the biggest challenge to the global community since the 1940s”.</p><p >A second wave of covid-19 continued to surge in <strong>India</strong>, with detected daily cases exceeding 60,000 several times. <strong>Pakistan</strong> is also suffering a new wave, in which the president, prime minister and defence minister have all tested positive.</p><p >The <strong>African Union</strong> signed a deal with Johnson &amp; Johnson to supply 220m doses of its single-jab vaccine to member states starting later this year.</p><p >The head of <strong>America’s</strong> Centres for Disease Control said she felt a sense of “impending doom” about rising infections in the country. Joe Biden said that 200m Americans should receive a <strong>vaccination</strong> by May 1st, double his previous goal.</p><p data-test-id="Footnote" >This article appeared in the The world this week section of the print edition under the headline &quot;Politics this week&quot;</p>
