As home minister and right-hand man to Narendra Modi, India’s prime minister, Mr Shah is regarded with awe and fear by both allies and opponents in the national capital. But in the sleepy Bengali town of Singur, ordinary voters are less sure what to make of him. From his convoy, he tossed out rose petals. Uniformed drummers danced. A phalanx of young men raised the party’s Hindu-oriented war cry. The townsfolk were mostly nonplussed. Ninety minutes later Mr Shah was back at the helipad on his way to another constituency. Three days later, on April 10th, Singur voted in the election that will choose a government for West Bengal. On May 2nd the ballots will be counted and the fate of the state revealed.</p><p >By the day of the road show, India’s official count of daily new infections of covid-19 had already surpassed its first peak last year. Since then, three of the candidates standing for the state’s 294 seats have died of covid-19. Midway through the eight-phase election, though, nothing could slow Mr Modi and Mr Shah’s Bharatiya Janata Party (<small>BJP</small>), which is determined to crush the incumbent state government led by the Trinamool Congress (<small>TMC</small>).The <small>BJP</small> has already swept past the once-indomitable Communists of West Bengal to become the state’s main opposition. It also effectively controls both houses of the national parliament, most of India’s nominally independent institutions and, with allies, 17 of its 28 states. Why then the all-out war—public health be damned—to win one more?</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p >The <small>TMC</small>’s leader, Mamata Banerjee, is part of the explanation. In recent years she has emerged as the fiercest critic of the <small>BJP</small> who wields actual power. Derek O’Brien, a <small>TMC</small> leader, judges that if Mr Modi were to win in West Bengal it would demoralise the rest of the opposition for decades to come. Ms Banerjee’s style is to fight back with sharp words and stagecraft, playing the underdog as she wheels around with her leg in a cast, an injury sustained while campaigning. She faces voter discontent over the petty corruption institutionalised by her party’s cadres. Yet she is not shy of using every advantage that comes with her office. In that respect she resembles Mr Modi, who capitalises on his firm control of the national government. National enforcement agencies, for instance, have a tendency to hound Ms Banerjee’s allies until they join the <small>BJP</small>. The Election Commission is also regarded as having taken Mr Modi’s side in the contest, for instance by showing lenience to its candidates who make anti-Muslim remarks.</p><p >Silencing Ms Banerjee is not the <small>BJP</small>’s only goal. The party’s Hindu-first, Muslim-last conception of nationalism has taken root in western India and the populous north. But it has struggled to find a foothold in the east (where West Bengal is located, confusingly) and in the south. Identitarian politics has not made much headway in Bengal. But if Bengali Hindus can be persuaded to think of themselves as Hindus first, the <small>BJP</small> should be able to lock in an enduring majority. About 30% of the state’s population is estimated to be Muslim, which makes Mr Modi’s sectarian politics look like a winning strategy.</p><p >The <small>BJP</small> argues that it would usher in “double-engine” growth, by co-ordinating central and state programmes and eliminating graft. Many ordinary Bengalis are interested in seeing whether their lot would indeed improve if, for once, they had a chief minister who got along with the prime minister. Lastly, the <small>BJP</small> must keep an eye on its position in the Rajya Sabha, the upper house of the national parliament, whose members are appointed by state legislatures. If, as seems inevitable, the <small>BJP</small> loses seats in northern states over a farmers’ agitation simmering around Delhi, it will need to compensate for those losses with gains from a big state somewhere else. West Bengal, with 100m people, fits the bill.</p><p >If the <small>BJP</small> prevails, its march across the country is nearly complete. Asked what summits remain to be scaled after Bengal, Mr Shah replied that “there are many states left”. He named the next five on his list. The <small>BJP</small> is nothing if not tenacious. <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p><p data-test-id="Footnote" >This article appeared in the Asia section of the print edition under the headline &quot;The road show must go on&quot;</p>
