Today, nearly a year later, most classrooms remain empty. According to the Centre on Reinventing Public Education, a research group, less than half of the country’s schools were offering full in-person instruction in December; nearly a third were teaching entirely online. President Joe Biden has vowed to reopen primary schools “five days a week” by his 100th day in office. But new <a href="https://www.economist.comhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/schools-childcare/indicators.html">guidelines</a> issued by America’s Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) call for schools to reopen fully only in places where infection rates are relatively low: fewer than 50 new cases per 100,000 people over seven days. According to the CDC’s latest data only 10% of counties fall below this threshold; in most of the country covid transmission rates are still “high” (see map).</p><p >A new <a href="https://www.economist.comhttps://www.nber.org/papers/w28455">working paper</a> by researchers at Michigan State University and the University of Washington suggests such limits may be sensible. To find out if in-person learning helps to spread the virus, the authors collected district-level data on how schools were teaching students in Michigan and Washington state in the autumn (in person, online or by a combination of the two) and matched them with data on new reported cases of covid-19. After controlling for relevant variables such as population density, race, political preferences and attitudes towards mask-wearing, they found that in-person schooling did accelerate the spread of the virus, but only in places where prevailing infection rates were relatively high. In Washington, in-person schooling began to contribute to community spread when the rate reached five new cases per 100,000 people per day; in Michigan this occurred at 19 new daily cases per 100,000 people. The spread of covid-19 in schools, they argue, has more do with the communities those schools are in than any danger inherent in classrooms themselves.</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p >But the debate around reopening America’s schools has strayed in recent weeks far beyond the question of whether the virus is under control at the local level. Teachers’ unions are pushing for teachers and school staff to be vaccinated before reopening. Some have even called for students to be inoculated before schools are reopened. But so far just 28 states and the District of Columbia have begun offering vaccines to teachers. Rochelle Walensky, the head of the CDC, said this month that vaccination is not a prerequisite for in-person learning. Although Mr Biden has said he believes teachers should be moved up the queue to get the vaccine, he cannot force states to comply.</p><p >Even if schools do open their doors, some Americans may be reluctant to send their children back. Black parents seem especially cautious. According to a survey from EducationNext, a journal, only 56% of African-American students who had access to in-person schooling in November took part, compared with 76% of their white peers. Attitudes are also split along party lines. Support for Donald Trump in 2016 was a strong predictor of districts’ decisions to reopen schools last autumn. Republicans are also less likely than Democrats to take precautions such as wearing a mask. If the schools that do open are also the ones least likely to follow the CDC’s guidance, the risk of cases spiking will increase.</p>
