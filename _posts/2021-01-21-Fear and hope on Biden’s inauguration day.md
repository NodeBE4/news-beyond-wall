In 2009 I was too junior a reporter to receive any invitations to the inaugural balls and I wanted to see how my hometown tidied itself up after the festivities. Two things stand out in my mind, 12 years on: the pride of the workers, all of whom, I think, were African-American; and the fact that, amid all the whirling rubbish on that freezing night, I didn’t spot a single discarded image of the president. Everyone had taken their posters home. </p><p >This year’s inauguration was practically rubbish-free because it was almost entirely spectator-free. Ordinarily, dignitaries wedge themselves into packed seating on the bunting-draped west front of the Capitol, home of Congress, and members of the public throng the National Mall, a well-kempt park running from the Capitol to the Lincoln Memorial on the banks of the Potomac river. In this pandemic year, chairs were instead placed in socially distanced pairs on the Capitol steps and organisers planted a field of flags on the Mall to represent the public whom they’d asked to stay home.</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p >Washington is usually heaving and thrumming with excitement in the days before an inauguration. This year it felt empty and on edge. Two weeks before Joe Biden became America’s second Catholic president, and Kamala Harris its first black, Asian-American and female vice-president, supporters of the now-ex President Donald Trump stormed the Capitol in a failed but deadly effort to keep their man in office. In the aftermath rumours of more violence abounded. Posts calling for a “Million Militia March” on January 20th circulated on social-media platforms and messageboards favoured by the far right, such as Parler and 4Chan.</p><blockquote><p>More troops were deployed in Washington, DC for the inauguration than are stationed in Afghanistan</p></blockquote><p >To deal with the threat, some 25,000 members of the National Guard, America’s military reserve, were deployed to Washington. Downtown streets normally packed with traffic stood empty – I could walk down the middle of the road for whole blocks at a time. Few businesses were open; many were boarded up. Not far from the White House the words “Trump won” were scrawled on some plywood boards protecting a restaurant window. Someone else had crossed out “won” and wrote “Lost!” </p><p >The troops, along with Secret Service agents and local police, manned vehicle and pedestrian checkpoints around the part of the city that contains the White House and a number of major federal buildings. Tall steel fencing on wheels closed off some streets. Huge lorries – taupe National Guard trucks and others seemingly borrowed from private companies – blocked others. The soldiers were heavily armed, young and unfailingly polite. Though they were happy to be photographed, they clammed up quickly whenever I pulled out a notebook or asked if I could turn on my recorder. Outside a public library, a contingent of National Guard troops from Missouri arranged their camouflage backpacks in neat rows on a patch of lawn. It looked like an art installation.</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p data-caps="initial" ><span data-caps="initial">T</span>wo days before Biden took office, at a charity event in honour of Martin Luther King day, Matt Miller, a 52-year-old Washington native, remarked that the security reminded him of the aftermath of the attacks of 9/11. He didn’t begrudge the measures. “I do think it’s only right”, he said, “that our government and our local law enforcement does whatever it takes to provide safety for the people of our city.” But the presence of soldiers was startling nonetheless: “I could never imagine anything like this happening.” Nor, probably, could anyone else. More troops were deployed in Washington for the inauguration than are stationed in Afghanistan. They were there not to defend Americans from foreign terrorist attacks but to protect them from supporters of a disgruntled former president.</p><figure data-image-nozoom="true"><div itemscope="" itemProp="image" itemType="https://schema.org/ImageObject"><meta itemProp="url" content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/851/90/1843magazine.com/sites/default/files/1843_20210121_FT_INAUGURATION_002.jpg"/><img loading="lazy" width="1280" height="851" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/851/90/1843magazine.com/sites/default/files/1843_20210121_FT_INAUGURATION_002.jpg"  sizes="(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw" alt=""/></div></figure><figure data-image-nozoom="true"><div itemscope="" itemProp="image" itemType="https://schema.org/ImageObject"><meta itemProp="url" content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/851/90/1843magazine.com/sites/default/files/1843_20210121_FT_INAUGURATION_003.jpg"/><img loading="lazy" width="1280" height="851" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/851/90/1843magazine.com/sites/default/files/1843_20210121_FT_INAUGURATION_003.jpg"  sizes="(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw" alt=""/></div></figure><figure data-image-nozoom="true"><div itemscope="" itemProp="image" itemType="https://schema.org/ImageObject"><meta itemProp="url" content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/850/90/1843magazine.com/sites/default/files/1843_20210121_FT_INAUGURATION_004.jpg"/><img loading="lazy" width="1280" height="850" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/850/90/1843magazine.com/sites/default/files/1843_20210121_FT_INAUGURATION_004.jpg"  sizes="(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw" alt=""/></div></figure><figure data-image-nozoom="true"><div itemscope="" itemProp="image" itemType="https://schema.org/ImageObject"><meta itemProp="url" content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/850/90/1843magazine.com/sites/default/files/1843_20210121_FT_INAUGURATION_005.jpg"/><img loading="lazy" width="1280" height="850" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/850/90/1843magazine.com/sites/default/files/1843_20210121_FT_INAUGURATION_005.jpg"  sizes="(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw" alt=""/></div></figure><figure data-image-nozoom="true"><div itemscope="" itemProp="image" itemType="https://schema.org/ImageObject"><meta itemProp="url" content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/850/90/1843magazine.com/sites/default/files/1843_20210121_FT_INAUGURATION_006.jpg"/><img loading="lazy" width="1280" height="850" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/850/90/1843magazine.com/sites/default/files/1843_20210121_FT_INAUGURATION_006.jpg"  sizes="(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw" alt=""/></div></figure><p >At a charity event in Anacostia, a historic neighbourhood of the capital, community activists gave away groceries, coats and clothes. Few out-of-towners visit this part of the city, but it is Washington’s beating heart. The elegant, narrow streets are lined with modest single-family homes, rather than offices and apartment blocks, and native Washingtonians, not transplants, live here. It feels cosy and welcoming rather than imposing. </p><p >Don Vito Premier, who runs Community Connoisseurs, a youth-focused charity group that was handing out the items, reflected on the awesome task that Biden faces: “There’s a huge group of people in the United States of America that are not happy with our system of government...Obviously there’s something that’s not right.” He added: “I don’t know what that something is, but hopefully our new president can look at that and see if we can address those issues.”</p><figure data-image-nozoom="true"><div itemscope="" itemProp="image" itemType="https://schema.org/ImageObject"><meta itemProp="url" content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/850/90/1843magazine.com/sites/default/files/1843_20210121_FT_INAUGURATION_007.jpg"/><img loading="lazy" width="1280" height="850" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/850/90/1843magazine.com/sites/default/files/1843_20210121_FT_INAUGURATION_007.jpg"  sizes="(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw" alt=""/></div></figure><figure data-image-nozoom="true"><div itemscope="" itemProp="image" itemType="https://schema.org/ImageObject"><meta itemProp="url" content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/850/90/1843magazine.com/sites/default/files/1843_20210121_FT_INAUGURATION_008.jpg"/><img loading="lazy" width="1280" height="850" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/850/90/1843magazine.com/sites/default/files/1843_20210121_FT_INAUGURATION_008.jpg"  sizes="(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw" alt=""/></div></figure><figure data-image-nozoom="true"><div itemscope="" itemProp="image" itemType="https://schema.org/ImageObject"><meta itemProp="url" content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/850/90/1843magazine.com/sites/default/files/1843_20210121_FT_INAUGURATION_009.jpg"/><img loading="lazy" width="1280" height="850" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/850/90/1843magazine.com/sites/default/files/1843_20210121_FT_INAUGURATION_009.jpg"  sizes="(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw" alt=""/></div></figure><figure data-image-nozoom="true"><div itemscope="" itemProp="image" itemType="https://schema.org/ImageObject"><meta itemProp="url" content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/1731/90/1843magazine.com/sites/default/files/1843_20210121_FT_INAUGURATION_010.jpg"/><img loading="lazy" width="1280" height="1731" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/1731/90/1843magazine.com/sites/default/files/1843_20210121_FT_INAUGURATION_010.jpg"  sizes="(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw" alt=""/></div></figure><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-3"></div></div></div><p >The new president wasted no time in getting to work. By 5pm he had visited the tomb of the unknown soldier in the Arlington National Cemetery and taken a brief, closely guarded walk in place of the traditional inaugural parade. Then he went to the Oval Office at the White House and signed a flurry of executive orders. Among other things, these made wearing masks on federal property compulsory, paved the way for America to rejoin the Paris climate accord, extended a moratorium on evictions, withdrew funding for the border wall with Mexico and ended Trump’s ban on travellers from several predominantly Muslim countries. As president, Trump often seemed motivated by animus towards Obama, gleefully undoing as much of his predecessor’s legacy as possible. On Biden’s first night in office, he showed that two can play that game.<span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p><p >PHOTOGRAPHS: <strong>BRUCE GILDEN</strong></p><br><hr><div>获取更多RSS：<br><a href="https://feedx.net" style="color:orange" target="_blank">https://feedx.net</a> <br><a href="https://feedx.xyz" style="color:orange" target="_blank">https://feedx.xyz</a><br></div>
