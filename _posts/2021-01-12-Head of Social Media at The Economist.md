Over the past 18 months we have completely rethought our approach to social media, tailoring content to each of our priority platforms and increasingly reflecting a digital-first approach.</p><p >Ever more people are encountering <em>The Economist</em> for the first time on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram or LinkedIn, where our accounts have a total of 50m followers. However, size is not everything and we want to do more to turn this audience into the next generation of subscribers.</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p >We are seeking someone with a significant record of success in social-media publishing and/or digital journalism to join our global team as Head of Social Media. This person will be based in our main newsroom in central London, but can be located remotely for now. They must already have the right to live and work in the United Kingdom.</p><p >They must understand <em>The Economist</em>’s brand and where it fits in the global media landscape. They will grasp the difference between a thread, a fleet and a carousel, will know how to use the link in our bio and will be able to easily turn a long-form article into a snappy, accurate, bite-sized piece of social content.</p><p >They will also be an effective and compassionate manager who can lead and motivate a group of talented journalists who were nominated for Social Media Team of the Year at The Drum Online Media Awards in 2020. Experience with push notifications, home-page management, SEO, newsletters and tools such as SocialFlow, Later, Photoshop and Parse.ly is a plus.</p><p >Ultimately, we are looking for an innovative self-starter with excellent editorial judgment, a keen eye for detail and a plan to turn our award-winning journalism into eye-catching content that reflects our values and wider editorial strategy.</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p >Applicants should submit an assessment of how <em>The Economist</em> currently uses social media to engage audiences, including a series of recommendations on what we could do better. This assessment is the most important part of the application, so make sure you explain your proposals thoroughly and clearly.</p><p >We will read this assessment blind (ie. without seeing your name or your experience). Only if what is written fits with what we are looking for will we examine the accompanying CV or resumé and consider the rest of your application. You should also include a cover letter that explains why you are the right person for the role.</p><p >All applications or enquiries should be sent to edsocialjob@economist.com. The closing date is Sunday January 31st 2021.</p><p ><em>The Economist Group values diversity. We are committed to equal opportunities and creating an inclusive environment for all our employees. We welcome applicants regardless of ethnic origin, national origin, gender, race, colour, religious beliefs, disability, sexual orientation or age.</em></p>
