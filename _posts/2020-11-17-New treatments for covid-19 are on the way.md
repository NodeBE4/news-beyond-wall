For covid-19, however, effective treatments are already in use at hospitals around the world. There is a good chance that more treatments will be added to the list in 2021—including some that will dramatically reduce the number of covid-19 sufferers who need to be hospitalised.</p><p >Things are moving fast. Just months after the disease emerged, clinical trials of several drugs turned up two winners. Dexamethasone, a cheap steroid, was found to improve survival in the most gravely ill covid-19 patients. Remdesevir, an anti-viral drug originally developed to treat Ebola, turned out to reduce the duration of covid-19 symptoms.</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p >With luck, at least one of the additions in 2021 will be a drug that prevents infected people from becoming ill. Such drugs are already used for influenza, rabies and many other diseases. For covid-19, the drug would be given to people who are at an early stage of infection. It could also be administered as a prophylaxis, both to those at high risk of catching the virus (such as health workers) and those likely to become severely ill (such as residents of care homes with covid-19 outbreaks).</p><p >The odds look good. In November 2020 the European Medicines Agency, the EU’s drug regulator, was in talks with the developers of 26 drugs for covid-19 that are already in clinical trials, plus 16 drugs that are at a pre-clinical stage.</p><p >Scientists will also begin to demystify the lasting, often hidden, effects of the disease on the heart and other parts of the body. Monitoring for such effects, and providing early treatment as needed, would soften any delayed blows from a covid-19 infection, including in people who may be unaware of having caught the virus. Studies looking for such effects have been running since mid-2020, and results will start to trickle in during the coming months. </p><p >The prognosis for those who suffer from “long covid”, a condition that appears to strike at random but is more common in middle-aged women, is less optimistic. About 1-2% of people with symptoms of covid-19 are still unwell three months after becoming infected, according to a study based on a symptom-tracking app in Britain. Preventing long covid in people who are already ill will be impossible, partly because their early symptoms are not specific enough to identify them as being at risk. But many of them will get better treatment for their lingering illness. Doctors are quickly learning how to diagnose the physical causes of their symptoms (which organs are malfunctioning, for example). As a result, many sufferers will get appropriate rehabilitation care earlier.</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p >Greater understanding and better treatments should make covid-19 less terrifying. For a disease that is here to stay, that would be a good prognosis.<span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p><p ><em>This article appeared in the Science and Technology section of the print edition of The World in 2021 under the headline “Getting better”</em></p><br><hr><div>获取更多RSS：<br><a href="https://feedx.net" style="color:orange" target="_blank">https://feedx.net</a> <br><a href="https://feedx.xyz" style="color:orange" target="_blank">https://feedx.xyz</a><br></div>
