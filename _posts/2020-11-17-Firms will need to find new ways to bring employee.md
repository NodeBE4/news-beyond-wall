The answer, surely, is teamwork. Corporate life in 2020 was disrupted by the pandemic and the need for many employees to work at home. Most companies got by, but they were living on the social capital they had accumulated in previous years. In 2021 they will want to refill the tank.</p><p >Many managers will have been surprised by how well the working-from-home experiment went. Research suggested that, before 2020, employees who stayed at home tended to be isolated from those who remained in the office. They regarded themselves as second-class citizens. But the pandemic meant that everyone was in the same boat, or rather the same living room. Managers learned that staff could be productive when not in the office; employees got used to taking part in video meetings. A study by the National Bureau of Economic Research found that home workers put in almost an hour extra a day compared with when they were in the office.</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p >The new arrangements worked because employees were already familiar with their roles and were used to the rhythm of the organisation. The weekly planning meeting could take place online; team discussions could be held on Slack or WhatsApp. Managers knew their staff’s individual strengths and weaknesses and thus whom to nag and whom to leave alone.</p><p >Over time, however, this coherence could deteriorate. Managers and staff will face new problems and will need to develop methods for tackling them. New staff will join and existing staff will transfer to new jobs. Accumulated knowledge will be less useful. New ways of working will have to be developed, which may need closer co-operation than can be achieved over a video link.</p><p >An element of productivity also results from serendipity: the chance discussion with someone outside your team. Those water-cooler moments are less likely when people are working from home. Employees may start to relate only to those within their immediate team or messaging group. The sales team may lose touch with product design, for example. Eventually this will erode the networks on which a company’s health may depend.</p><p >That is why companies will spend 2021 trying to restore the collective spirit. Even if employees do not come back to the office full-time, they will probably be asked to return for at least one or two days a week. When they do, they will be engineered into meeting with those outside their immediate hierarchy, to stop the company turning into a battle between “us” and “them”.</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p >All this may also involve some socially distanced version of awaydays, designed to break down barriers between departments. Zoom drinks events are already common but some employers have sent wine or beer to employees to encourage participation. Other events include trivia quizzes, online karaoke and scavenger hunts in which workers compete to find items within their own homes. Companies will survey employees to test the state of morale. Human-resources departments will be called upon to do a lot of extra work, beyond the firefighting role of sorting out problematic relationships.</p><p >The big risk in the medium term is the emergence of two cultures, as has happened in the gig economy, where the workforce is split into a small number of core staff and a larger number of contracted or casual workers. The pandemic may create another split, as older, established workers stay at home and younger staff, despite going into the office, have fewer opportunities to bond with colleagues, build professional networks and climb the ladder. Team spirit will be harder to create than before—whatever fine words the chief executive uses.<span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p><p ><em>This article appeared in the Business section of the print edition of The World in 2021 under the headline “Bonding from home”</em></p><br><hr><div>获取更多RSS：<br><a href="https://feedx.net" style="color:orange" target="_blank">https://feedx.net</a> <br><a href="https://feedx.xyz" style="color:orange" target="_blank">https://feedx.xyz</a><br></div>
