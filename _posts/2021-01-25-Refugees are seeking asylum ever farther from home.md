The United Nations’ refugee convention forbids governments from sending them back home if they are at risk. In practice, most countries are less than welcoming, and numbers of asylum-seekers are largely determined by geography: they often end up staying for years in the first country where they seek refuge, which tends to be next to the one they are fleeing. So Afghan refugees in the 1990s were stuck in Iran and Pakistan. And those fleeing the war in Syria have arrived in Turkey, Jordan and other neighbouring countries. When they have tried to reach the European Union, it is in the front-line states—Greece, Italy and Spain—where they have arrived, and which receive a disproportionate share of asylum claims.</p><p >A <a href="https://www.economist.comhttps://www.nber.org/papers/w28332">recent working paper</a> by economists at the World Bank and the University of Michigan suggests that this pattern is changing. Using data compiled by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees from 1987 to 2017, the authors analysed the changing spatial distribution of refugees and asylum-seekers over time. They found that most people escaping their home countries still seek refuge in neighbouring ones, even those that are poor, at war or experiencing instability. The majority of refugees from South Sudan, for example, around 2.2m, have been taken in by neighbouring Sudan, Ethiopia, Kenya and Uganda.</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p >But refugee flows are becoming more globalised, as migrants travel longer distances and to more diverse destinations to seek protection (see chart). In the late 1980s the average distance travelled by a refugee was roughly 1,000km; it reached 2,300km in 2006 before falling to 1,800km in the past decade. Many refugees are venturing beyond neighbouring countries, because those countries lack adequate resources, because unrest is spilling over the border or because they believe that faraway countries—in Europe or North America, say—offer better opportunities. A growing number are settling in the rich world. The authors estimate that in 1990 less than 5% of refugees resided in rich OECD countries; by the mid-2000s, this share had grown to nearly 25%; in 2017 it was 15%.</p><p >Even as refugees travel farther afield to seek sanctuary, the political pressures in receiving countries will remain. In September the European Commission proposed a new pact to manage the influx of refugees arriving at Europe’s borders. The proposal would remove the compulsory refugee quotas introduced in 2015, which were often disregarded, in favour of a system in which member states would either accept more migrants or take responsibility for sending those denied asylum back to their home countries. Some countries, including Greece, have cheered the proposed deal. The migrants arriving on Europe’s shores may be less enthusiastic.</p>
