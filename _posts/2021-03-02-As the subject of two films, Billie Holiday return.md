Born in Baltimore in 1915, Holiday grew up in a poor but tight-knit neighbourhood. She was raped at the age of 10, blamed for “seducing” her adult attacker and sent to a reformatory for girls. She and her mother later moved to New York, where Holiday became a sex worker in order to survive; she was arrested and jailed for prostitution when she was 15. After her release, she launched her music career and enjoyed two decades of success before her death in 1959, aged 44. </p><p >Two recent films chronicle this tempestuous life. “Billie”, a documentary, is based on hundreds of previously unheard interviews with Holiday’s friends, relatives and musical collaborators. In the 1970s Linda Lipnack Kuehl, a journalist, sought to deepen her understanding of Holiday; she conducted these conversations in the hope of writing a definitive biography of the jazz great. (Kuehl died before completing the work.)</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p >The testimonies in “Billie” make clear that singing was a balm for Holiday as she grappled with the effects of childhood trauma. The music industry was not a welcoming place: some managers considered her too light-skinned to sing with Count Basie and his jazz band, and she was forced to darken her face. But she often resisted the demands of her employers—particularly with her haunting performances of “Strange Fruit”, which became part of her repertoire in 1939 despite opposition from the American government. The lyrics, which describe the hanged bodies of lynched African-Americans, were written by Abel Meeropol, a white Jewish communist and schoolteacher from the Bronx. Lady Day made them her own, imbuing her performance with the pain of her own experiences.</p><p >For the next two decades American officials tried to silence the singer, fearing that between Holiday’s popularity and the stark words of her song, she would help galvanise an African-American protest movement. Agents led by Harry Anslinger, then the head of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics, conducted numerous raids to look for drugs in an attempt to discredit Holiday, who was known to have a heroin addiction. </p><p >They framed these intrusions, as well as much of their harassment of black people more broadly, as necessary to eradicate drugs. (In contrast, when Anslinger learned that Judy Garland was an addict, he advised her to take more breaks from work and wrote to her studio to say that she did not have a drug problem.) After Holiday performed “Strange Fruit” at a concert in Philadelphia in 1947, the feds searched her room, leading to a car chase and a shootout. She was charged with possession of narcotics and given a year-long sentence at her trial, <em>The United States of America v Billie Holiday</em>.</p><figure><div itemscope="" itemProp="image" itemType="https://schema.org/ImageObject" data-slim="0"><meta itemProp="url" content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/720/90/sites/default/files/images/2021/03/blogs/prospero/20210306_bkp504.jpg"/><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/720/90/sites/default/files/images/2021/03/blogs/prospero/20210306_bkp504.jpg"  sizes="(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw" alt=""/></div></figure><p >A new biopic of the singer takes its name from that case. Directed by Lee Daniels, “The United States vs Billie Holiday” (pictured) focuses on the latter half of the musician’s life. The movie opens in 1957, with Reginald Lord Devine (Leslie Jordan) interviewing Holiday. She begins reflecting on her life ten years earlier, when she had been a regular singer at Café Society, the venue where she first performed “Strange Fruit”. After a captivating rendition of “All of Me”, fans line up outside her dressing room to meet her. Among them is Jimmy Fletcher (Trevante Rhodes). Unbeknown to Holiday, Fletcher is a narcotics agent tasked with gaining her trust by Anslinger (Garrett Hedlund). A relentless campaign to derail Holiday’s career ensues. </p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p >Andra Day shines in the main role, emulating Holiday’s voice and charisma (she won a Golden Globe on February 28th for her portrayal). But it is a shame that she did not have more nuanced material to work with. The film provides glimpses of the discrimination Holiday endured, but fails to make it matter to the plot. It does not deliver on the promised story of the singer’s importance as an early civil-rights leader. </p><p >At one point in “The United States vs Billie Holiday”, she tells Fletcher: “I don’t think people know I care about these things.” And for the most part, she is right. Holiday’s interest in civil rights is shown as just one among many concerns, all of which are then superseded in importance by the romance between Holiday and Fletcher. Not even the scene of the trial from which the movie gets its name leaves a particularly strong impression. The most powerful moment in the film is when Ms Day sings “Strange Fruit” in its entirety. </p><p >Condensing the story of Lady Day into a feature-length film in a way that does not simply rehash the facts is a difficult job. In “Billie” Kuehl’s archive—exhaustive as it is—presents a contradictory portrait of Holiday, including at the level of historical details. The sources cannot agree on whether Holiday was fired from Count Basie’s band or if she left of her own accord. She was a victim of racism and sexism, but she was by no means helpless. She was a fun-loving coquette whose voice appealed because it was world-weary. Holiday was many things, which is to say that above all, she was human.</p><p ><em>“Billie” is available to watch via Amazon in America and the BFI Player in Britain from March 29th. “The United States vs Billie Holiday” is streaming on Hulu now</em></p><br><hr><div>获取更多RSS：<br><a href="https://feedx.net" style="color:orange" target="_blank">https://feedx.net</a> <br><a href="https://feedx.top" style="color:orange" target="_blank">https://feedx.top</a><br></div>
