The parties expected to support a government led by Binyamin Netanyahu, the current prime minister, are unlikely to win a majority of seats in the Knesset (Israel’s 120-seat parliament). But none of his rivals seems to have the support of a majority either. Political stalemate is nothing new for Israel. It has held four elections in less than two years, each failing to produce a stable government. A new election, which would be held this summer, is a distinct possibility. Why do Israelis need <a href="https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2021/03/20/binyamin-netanyahu-hopes-to-win-yet-another-election-in-israel" data-tegid="i4ng336bi1nsuiravcrkdqaa6flqig67">so many elections</a> to form a new government?</p><p >The Knesset is elected through a nationwide proportional-representation system with a relatively low electoral threshold (currently 3.25% of the total vote) for parties to win seats. No single party has ever won a majority in the Knesset and therefore governments are always formed by coalition. Since these parties differ in their positions and the constituencies they serve, the coalitions are often fractious affairs which do not contribute to stable governments. Although in theory the Knesset’s term can be as long as five years, it is almost always dissolved sooner. This was Israel’s 24th parliamentary election in 72 years. But even by these short-lived standards, four elections in less than two years is unprecedented. </p><p ><iframe height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8IUjBSSIs6s?enablejsapi=1"></iframe></p><p >The real reason for the continuous stalemate is that in recent years Israeli politics has ceased almost entirely to be about ideology or policies. The one issue that now divides the parties in the Knesset is whether they are prepared to join a government led by the <a href="https://www.economist.com/briefing/2019/03/30/the-success-of-binyamin-netanyahus-divisive-politics-in-israel">long-serving Mr Netanyahu</a>. Left-wing parties refuse because of his right-wing nationalist policies. But some centrist and even right-wing parties, once willing to work with Mr Netanyahu’s Likud party, also object to serving under him. This is partly because of the multiple corruption charges against him, for which he is <a href="https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2019/11/21/binyamin-netanyahu-vows-to-fight-on-despite-charges-of-bribery-and-fraud">currently on trial</a>, and partly because of his increasingly autocratic style of governing. </p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p >Since much of the opposition to Mr Netanyahu is personal rather than ideological, and comes from diverse parts of the Israeli political spectrum, including hard-core Jewish nationalists and Arab communists, the only thing the opposition parties can agree on is their desire to replace the prime minister. A small majority of Israelis (around 55% in recent polls) want to see Mr Netanyahu leave, but the parties they vote for are incapable of uniting behind an agreed alternative candidate or sitting together in one coalition. Unless Mr Netanyahu manages to put together a coalition with a small majority, or the opposition finally gets its act together, Israel may soon be headed for yet another election. </p><p ><strong>Dig deeper:</strong><br/><a href="https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2021/03/20/binyamin-netanyahu-hopes-to-win-yet-another-election-in-israel" data-tegid="i4ng336bi1nsuiravcrkdqaa6flqig67">Binyamin Netanyahu hopes to win yet another election in Israel</a><br/><a href="https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2021/01/02/binyamin-netanyahu-faces-a-challenge-from-the-right">Israel&#x27;s prime minister faces a challenge from the right</a><br/><a href="https://www.economist.com/leaders/2019/03/30/binyamin-netanyahu-a-parable-of-modern-populism">Binyamin Netanyahu: a parable of modern populism</a></p>
