On March 13th, hundreds of people gathered on Clapham Common in London to mourn Sarah Everard, a marketing executive, whose murder—for which a serving police officer has been charged—sparked an outpouring of anger and solidarity among women. The Metropolitan Police, which had declined to give the vigil’s organisers a permit on the grounds that it would breach lockdown rules, swooped in and arrested four people.</p><div ><figure ><figcaption>Listen to this story</figcaption><audio  controls="" id="audio-player" preload="none" src="https://www.economist.com/media-assets/audio/049%20Britain%20-%20Protest-a1f81ec6fb4d97076ce57a7ec770e212.mp3" title="Boris Johnson wants to restrict the right to protest" controlsList="nodownload"><p>Your browser does not support the &lt;audio&gt; element.</p></audio></figure><p >Enjoy more audio and podcasts on<!-- --> <a id="audio-ios-cta" href="https://www.economist.comhttps://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1239397626?pt=344884&amp;ct=article%20audio%20player&amp;mt=8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">iOS</a> <!-- -->or<!-- --> <a id="audio-android-cta" href="https://www.economist.comhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.economist.lamarr&amp;referrer=utm_source%3Darticle%2520audio%2520player" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Android</a>.</p></div><p >On March 16th, Parliament voted on the government’s Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts bill—a rag-bag of measures which includes a clampdown on the right to protest in England and Wales. The government had hoped the bill would slide through Parliament unobserved, but the timing turned it into the centre of a controversy. As <small>MP</small>s debated the bill hundreds of protesters blocked Westminster Bridge to traffic.</p><p >The curbs on protest are aimed at movements which the government, dominated by social conservatives, abhors. Priti Patel, the home secretary, has described Extinction Rebellion (<small>XR</small>) as “eco-crusaders turned criminals” and protests organised by Black Lives Matter (<small>BLM</small>) as “dreadful”.</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p >The government reckons that the Public Order Act 1986, drawn up in the era of trade-union marches, is ill-equipped to deal with these movements’ tactics. At present protests can be restricted only if they are likely to cause serious damage to property or disruption to communities. <small>XR</small> and <small>BLM</small> have a talent for spectacle. <small>BLM</small>’s supporters have removed and defaced statues. <small>XR</small>’s members climb on top of Tube trains and occupy bridges; music often forms part of their demonstrations. </p><p >If the bill is enacted, the maximum penalty for causing less than £5,000 worth of damage to a statue will rise from three months in jail to ten years. Protests can be restricted if the noise they create may be grounds for restricting them if it has a “relevant impact” on, or they cause “serious unease” to people nearby. Protests by a single person can be subject to restrictions.</p><p >Critics maintain that the rules amount to the silencing of protest. “If Priti Patel was heading up homeland security in the <small>US</small> in 1963, Martin Luther King would be whispering his ‘I Have A Dream’ speech in a parking lot outside <small>DC,</small> rather than relaying it to millions in front of the Lincoln Memorial,” says Raj Chada, a lawyer who specialises in protest law.</p><p >The proposals reveal the Conservative Party’s contradictions. Many <small>MP</small>s have defended freedom of speech, particularly that of right-leaning academics in left-wing universities. Yet they are more ambivalent about its cousin, freedom of assembly—and so are their voters. A YouGov poll found that 43% of Britons thought the Clapham vigil should not have gone ahead; 40% thought it should have. Among Tory voters the figures were 61% to 28%. “The problem is our Conservative coalition now includes a lot of working people,” says a Tory <small>MP</small>. “It’s not that they are philosophical collectivist authoritarians, aka fascists; it’s just that they are not putting up with this nonsense, and then that gets reflected in the policies.” Taking a tough line on law and order has the happy by-product of sowing divisions within Labour. The party’s membership tends to like protests. Its voters, a more traditional bunch, do not. </p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p >There is some disquiet. In the second-reading debate Theresa May, a former hardline home secretary and prime minister, said that freedom depends on knowing the fine line between “popular and populist”. But the bill passed by a majority of 96.</p><p >Still, Britons are unlikely to put down their placards. The bill has succeeded in uniting disparate protest groups. A statement signed by 99 branches of <small>XR</small>, <small>BLM</small> and other groups pledged to “continue to unite and fight” against the government. The protests may have also made many more voters a little more aware of the importance of the liberties that the bill undermines. And will <small>XR</small> still descend on <small>COP</small>26 come November? “You bet,” says an <small>XR</small> spokesperson. <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p><p ><em>Correction (March 19th 2021): This article has been corrected to reflect the fact that the bill applies only to England and Wales. </em></p><p data-test-id="Footnote" >This article appeared in the Britain section of the print edition under the headline &quot;No more parades&quot;</p><br><hr><div>获取更多RSS：<br><a href="https://feedx.net" style="color:orange" target="_blank">https://feedx.net</a> <br><a href="https://feedx.top" style="color:orange" target="_blank">https://feedx.top</a><br></div>
