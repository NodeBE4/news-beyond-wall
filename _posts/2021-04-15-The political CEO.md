Today the mixing of government and corporations is happening in America. Sometimes that is in pursuit of honourable causes, as in the protest of <small>CEO</small>s over new laws restricting voting in Georgia and other states. Sometimes it is visible in the statesman-<small>CEO</small>: the latest manifesto from Jamie Dimon, boss of JPMorgan Chase, pronounces on military procurement and criminal justice among many other weighty concerns. Most broadly of all, it is reflected in how the Business Roundtable, a lobbying group, has extended the corporate remit to include serving all stakeholders, for the success of their firms, communities and country.</p><p >This newspaper strongly supports the protection of voting rights. We believe that companies operating in competitive markets advance social progress. Nonetheless, as classical liberals, we also believe that concentrations of power are dangerous. Businesspeople will always lobby for their own advantage, but the closer they get to the government, the more harm they threaten to both the economy and politics.</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p >America pioneered the separation of business from politicians in the 19th century by ending the requirement for limited-liability firms to be chartered by the state. This innovation cut against patronage and helped make America rich. Relations between the state and firms have still been turbulent, from the ambition and graft of the Gilded Age, to corporatism after 1945 (see <a href="https://www.economist.com/business/2021/04/14/ceo-activism-in-america-is-risky-business">article</a>). In recent decades the dominant thinking has looked to Milton Friedman, a 20th-century economist who argued that bosses’ authority derives from firms’ owners, and that they should prioritise owners’ interests, which are usually to maximise long-term profits.</p><p >Few firms ever lived up to that ideal, but today they are openly rejecting it because of several forces. As more citizens want firms to support causes they hold dear, <small>CEO</small>s who remain silent risk being accused of complicity. Fund managers seek to evaluate firms’ “social and governance” scores, in response to demand from their clients—and to charge juicier fees. Tech firms exercise <a href="https://www.economist.com/united-states/2021/04/15/will-facebooks-supreme-court-reinstate-donald-trumps-account" data-tegid="hommjo2dpqbmlq1gcobq3ii8htnfchob">influence over political speech</a>. Many Americans think the government in Washington is broken and may hope businesses can fill the vacuum. Donald Trump bullied and enticed business. President Joe Biden has a big-government agenda that is founded on an alliance with business to bring about national renewal, to fight climate change and to gird America against the rise of China.</p><p >Even if those goals are individually laudable, all this amounts to a shift in the role of business that brings underappreciated risks. One is of a display of hypocrisy that discredits everyone. Many socially conscious investment funds are stuffed with the shares of tech giants accused of antitrust violations. Members of the Business Roundtable who took the pledge to look after all their stakeholders went on to cut hundreds of thousands of jobs last year, and are busy campaigning against tax rises to pay for the social cost of the pandemic. To want to defend voting rights, which are central to democracy, is only natural. But that leads ineluctably to the next test—over support for, say, new federal voting laws, reform of the Supreme Court and boycotts of China over human-rights abuses in Xinjiang. If <small>CEO</small>s claim that their companies are moral actors, will they be consistent?</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p >The vigour of the economy is at stake too. Calls for companies to serve all stakeholders risk being vacuous because they provide little guidance on how to prioritise their competing claims or measure the performance of <small>CEO</small>s. A healthy corporate scene is heterogeneous, not uniform: even in an economy that is creating jobs some companies need to fire people, and a country that is slashing emissions still needs some firms to sell oil. Some of today’s companies are already protected thanks to their ties to the government, at the expense of the innovative outsiders who are not. Consider Delta Air Lines, which lobbied in private to amend the voting legislation in Georgia. It is part of an oligopoly that hurts consumers, has just received $8.5bn of government cash, cut its workforce by 19% during the pandemic and is an important polluter.</p><p >The risk to politicians is more subtle. Their inconsistency is blatant: progressives who once abhorred corporate involvement in politics now urge it, while Republican leaders who cosied up to big business now want it silenced. But politicians routinely deflect accusations of hypocrisy. The real danger is that when business is asked to help solve political problems, like voting reform, executives exploit their seat at the table to promote their own narrow interests. There is a profound dissonance in the idea that popular discontent with politics can be resolved by giving more power to an elite of unelected <small>CEO</small>s.</p><p >The competition Friedman endorsed is a better way of thinking about companies and politics. Competition makes it legitimate and lucrative to embrace social change. In a market firms must anticipate and adapt to society’s preferences. Consumers want more humane and less wasteful products, so firms are innovating to provide them, from Beyond Meat to Tesla, in turn forcing McDonald’s and General Motors to adapt. In order to recruit the best staff, firms increasingly need open and diverse cultures. And to thrive in the long-term, companies must anticipate how laws on externalities will change as public opinion shifts. Few capitalists today would make lasting investments based on an assumption of zero taxes on carbon emissions or supplies from labour camps in Xinjiang.</p><p >Perhaps the new corporate agenda is just another front in this competition—marketing to win over talent and customers. If so, better and more effective tactics are available, such as Home Depot’s programme to raise voting turnout among its staff. Because make no mistake, companies are not a substitute for effective government. It is the state that ensures markets are competitive and not skewed by monopolies or corruption. Only governments can tax externalities such as pollution and build a social safety-net. And the only legitimate way to mediate America’s bitter divisions and protect its fundamental rights is through the political process and the courts—not the executive suite. <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p><p data-test-id="Footnote" >This article appeared in the Leaders section of the print edition under the headline &quot;The political CEO&quot;</p>
