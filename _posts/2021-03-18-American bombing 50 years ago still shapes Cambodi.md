In Cambodia, however, such land often signifies danger rather than abundance. When America dropped an estimated 1.8m tonnes of explosives on the country during the Vietnam war, those falling on flinty ground generally detonated, whereas many landing on softer earth did not. No one knows how many bombs remain in rich soil. But a paper by four academics at Ohio State University (<small>OSU</small>), who studied satellite images and reports by landmine-removal groups from a single village, found that perhaps half of the munitions have not exploded.</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p >These wartime remnants have given the United States’ bombing campaign of 1965-73—which ostensibly targeted Viet Cong supply lines, but caused perhaps 150,000 deaths—an enduringly lethal legacy. Since 1979, unexploded ordnance has killed at least 19,000 people in Cambodia (though some may have been blown up by landmines from subsequent wars, rather than by American bombs). Cambodia now has the world’s highest rate of amputees.</p><p >A recent study by Erin Lin, one of the <small>OSU</small> researchers, shows that America’s bombardment injured not just Cambodia’s people but its economy as well. She first interviewed farmers in the country, who said they thought that richer, darker soil presented an unusually high risk of hidden ordnance—especially in heavily bombed areas. They work in constant fear of explosions. Some said that they only planted crops in parts of their farms that they were confident contained no bombs, or that they used hand tools instead of machines to reduce the risk of detonation.</p><p >To quantify this behaviour, Ms Lin used agricultural and census records to produce village- and farm-level estimates of investment, productivity, income and soil quality. She then mapped these data to the precise sites of American bombing. After making adjustments for factors such as rice prices and differences between regions in economic conditions before the war, she found that in areas with relatively barren earth, there was no relationship between the two variables. Historical bombardment does not affect farmers’ methods in such places, because bombs that hit rocky ground almost always exploded.</p><figure  data-infographic-></figure><figure><iframe height="NaN" src="https://infographics.economist.com/2021/20210320_GDC100_2/index.html" data-size="full-width"></iframe></figure><p >However, in regions with rich soil, aerial attacks 50 years ago make a measurable difference today. Among farms in fertile areas, those in places that were bombed are unusually unproductive. Ms Lin estimates that the share of land planted with crops is about 12 percentage points lower in such farms than in others located in similarly fruitful regions which were spared by the Americans. This shrinks harvests, reducing by half the amount of rice that owners have left over to sell after feeding themselves, and cutting incomes by 40%.</p><p >Cambodia suffered years of war and genocide after the bombing ceased, and America is just one of many parties to blame for the country’s tribulations. Yet it is a testament to the horror of the bombing that despite the anguish that followed, its signature can still be detected today.<span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p><p data-interactive- >Source: “How war changes land: soil fertility, unexploded bombs, and the underdevelopment of Cambodia”, by Erin Lin, 2020</p><figure data-infographic-js="1"></figure><p data-test-id="Footnote" >This article appeared in the Graphic detail section of the print edition under the headline &quot;Blood and soil&quot;</p><br><hr><div>获取更多RSS：<br><a href="https://feedx.net" style="color:orange" target="_blank">https://feedx.net</a> <br><a href="https://feedx.top" style="color:orange" target="_blank">https://feedx.top</a><br></div>
