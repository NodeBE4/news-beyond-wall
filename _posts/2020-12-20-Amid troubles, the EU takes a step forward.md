A rare outburst of agreement meant that at least the EU is not heading into 2021 without a budget. EU leaders, meeting for once in person rather than by Zoom, approved a €1.1trn ($1.3trn) <a href="https://www.economist.com/europe/2020/12/19/the-eu-gives-itself-a-weapon-to-battle-against-rule-of-law-violations">budget</a> to cover the next seven years. Perhaps even better news was that they also managed to bolt down a €750bn fund to help countries recover from the pandemic, something that had been in the works for months but had been held up by a row over whether places like Poland or Hungary which are accused of violating the rule of law can be punished by having payments withheld.</p><p >More significant still, the EU had earlier also agreed for the first time that this money would be raised by issuing <a href="https://www.economist.com/europe/2020/07/21/the-eus-leaders-have-agreed-on-a-eu750bn-covid-19-recovery-package">jointly-guaranteed bonds</a>, a step towards the mutualisation of debt that poorer southern countries have long wished for and the north has long resisted. Some called it a “Hamiltonian moment”, echoing Alexander Hamiton’s success as America’s first treasury secretary in getting the federal government to assume the debts of the 13 American states after the war of independence, a crucial building-block of the new union.</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p >It was almost the only bit of good news, though. As well as the deep economic hit from covid-19, not to mention hundreds of thousands of untimely deaths, most EU leaders had to grapple with political tensions, collapsing approval ratings and in a number of cases coalition woes. Most managed to stagger through them, though the government in Italy looks precarious, and the leaders of Ireland, Malta and Romania all departed. Poland’s president only narrowly clung on. France was horrified by the <a href="https://www.economist.com/europe/2020/10/18/the-beheading-of-a-teacher-will-harden-frances-belief-in-secularism">murder of Samuel Paty</a>, a schoolteacher who had shown controversial cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad to his class. President Emmanuel Macron firmly defended the right to free speech, and was criticised by many Muslims around the world. The controversy continued after he <a href="https://www.economist.com/europe/2020/12/09/emmanuel-macron-unveils-a-controversial-bill-to-fight-islamism">unveiled a law</a> which will strengthen state control over Islamic organisations.</p><p >Beyond the EU’s borders, the picture was much less pretty. War came to the periphery, in the shape of a nasty scrap between <a href="https://www.economist.com/europe/2020/10/03/war-returns-to-nagorno-karabakh">Armenia and Azerbaijan</a> over the long-disputed enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh, which sits in Azerbaijan but is mostly populated by ethnic Armenians. Thanks mainly to strong support from their Turkish allies, the Azerbaijanis managed to eject Armenia from almost all of the territory it seized in the 1990s to connect the enclave with Armenia proper. The EU found itself entirely marginalised as Russia and Turkey redrew the region’s borders.</p><p >Even closer to home, in fact on the bloc’s very border, months of protests and a bloody crackdown followed a fraudulent election in <a href="https://www.economist.com/europe/2020/08/13/after-rigging-an-election-belaruss-regime-beats-protesters">Belarus</a>, where the president, Alexander Lukashenko, declared himself elected for the sixth consecutive time and proceeded to expel his rival, whom most observers believe to have won. The fate of that rival, Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, now in exile in Lithuania, is a standing reproach to the EU, which has acted slowly and feebly in the matter.</p><p >Just as feeble has been its response to Vladimir Putin, Russia’s president. Not only has he continued to defend the actions of Mr Lukashenko, but he also allowed his security apparatus to attempt to <a href="https://www.economist.com/europe/2020/10/17/an-interview-with-alexei-navalny-assassination-survivor">murder his main political rival</a>, Alexei Navalny, with a nerve agent. Mr Navalny was allowed to leave Russia for treatment in Germany, where the chancellor, Angela Merkel, rather bravely visited him—one of the few examples of the EU saying boo to the Russian strongman.</p>
