Rather than being packed and buzzing, the House chamber—which a mob of insurrectionists had stormed only four months before in an attempt to prevent his ascension—was sparsely filled with masked and distanced grandees. The austere setting did not upset his speech, delivered on the eve of his 100th day in office. “Tonight, I come to talk about crisis and opportunity,” Mr Biden began. “Now, after just 100 days, I can report to the nation: America is on the move again.”</span></p><p >The president took the opportunity first to mark his accomplishments, primarily the passage of a $1.9trn covid-19 relief bill that, among other things, sent $1,400 cheques to most Americans and established a generous child benefit expected to cut child poverty in half. He also noted optimistic indicators: a fast pace of vaccination (more than 200m shots administered compared with his campaign pledge of 100m), the accelerating pace of employment recovery and optimistic forecasts for economic growth in the post-vaccination year. In a speech that rarely broke its focus from economic policy—flitting between the bipartisan kind and the populist, progressive variety—Mr Biden hawked two proposed legislative packages, which aim to spend more than $4trn over the coming decade. It was an attempt at a direct bid to the American people, with little of the soaring rhetoric usually employed in such addresses, for the legislation that will probably determine Mr Biden’s legacy.</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p >The first portion of the Biden deal, the $2.7trn American Jobs Plan, was unveiled last month. Its goal is to create millions of jobs by building traditional infrastructure (roads, bridges, power lines), preparing the country for rapid decarbonisation and caring for the elderly. Making direct overtures to Americans who are “forgotten in an economy that’s rapidly changing”, Mr Biden pitched the idea as a “blue-collar blueprint to build America”. “When I think about climate change,” he went on, <span><span>“I think jobs.” He quite liked the j-word, using it more than 30 times </span></span>(and noting that 90% of the infrastructure positions he aims to create would not require a college degree). There is an unrelenting autarkic commitment, popular yet inefficient, throughout the Biden agenda, spelled out in this address in no uncertain terms: “American tax dollars are going to be used to buy American products made in America that create American jobs.”</p><p >Mr Biden also chose this moment to lay out the second portion of his grand scheme, the $1.8trn American Families Plan, which aims to reweave the American safety-net. Among its ambitious proposals are paid family-leave, the expansion of anti-poverty credits created by the covid-19 relief package, universal preschool, heavily subsidised child care and two free years of community college. The White House claims that it will be able to <a href="https://www.economist.com/leaders/2021/04/28/how-to-tax-capital-without-hurting-investment">pay for it all</a> by raising taxes on corporations and wealthy Americans. Mr Biden wants to raise the corporate-tax rate from 21% to 28% to help subsidise the jobs plan. The families plan, meanwhile, would be underpinned by higher marginal tax rates on rich Americans, doubling capital-gains tax rates on Americans making more than $1m a year and ambitious tax audits.</p><p >On the whole, Mr Biden’s safety-net proposals are sensible. America is one of the few developed countries that lacks paid family or medical leave. Preschool is only haphazardly accessible. Increasingly, many decent-paying jobs require some sort of college degree. Mr Biden largely sidestepped health care, eschewing serious surgery in favour of modest reforms, such as reducing prescription-drug prices by letting the government negotiate them down, and increasing health-insurance subsidies. </p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p ><span>There were also some missteps. Despite Mr Biden’s generally maximalist plans, he has opted to extend the poverty-reducing child allowances for four years rather than proposing to make them permanent. He may calculate that gives the proposal a greater chance of passing Congress. But it is odd that he has chosen to pre-emptively negotiate on perhaps his most important safety-net reform. </span>Similarly his idea, cribbed from Elizabeth Warren, to limit families from paying more than 7% of their income on child-care sounds sensible. But it could mean, as it stands, that the federal government would pay $10,000 in day-care fees for the child of a family in Washington, DC making as much as $127,000 a year.</p><p >These are just the starting positions for what will probably be a bruising battle in Congress. Unlike some of his executive orders, his speech was minimally woke: just a few late, passing references to systemic racism. There was little discussion of immigration policy, another thorny issue on which Democrats are usually defensive. Yet, despite Mr Biden’s rhetorical appeals for bipartisanship, Republicans remain largely unmoved. “Even more taxing, even more spending,” aptly summarised Tim Scott, the Republican senator who offered the rebuttal to the president’s speech. There is a chance too that Mr Biden’s attention will be taken by events outside of his planning. A crisis on the southern border might force some attempt at resolving a heretofore unresolvable problem. An eruption in Afghanistan, the South China Sea or Ukraine could force the president to break his square focus on domestic concerns.</p><p ><span>Of the crises that Mr Biden inherited when he took his oath of office—the ones he sees as opportunities—progress has only been made on some. The fallout of covid-19 is certainly diminishing, and the economy is recovering. America remains as polarised as ever, though Mr Biden sees things more rosily: “We have stared into an abyss of insurrection and autocracy—of pandemic and pain—and ‘we the people’ did not flinch.” Remarkably, after all that has happened, the president insisted that “I have never been more confident or more optimistic about America”. It is not a sentiment widely shared, but perhaps an encouraging one all the same.</span></p><br><hr><div>获取更多RSS：<br><a href="https://feedx.net" style="color:orange" target="_blank">https://feedx.net</a> <br><a href="https://feedx.top" style="color:orange" target="_blank">https://feedx.top</a><br></div>
