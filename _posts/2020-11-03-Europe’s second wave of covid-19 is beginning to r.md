In the past week Belgium, England, France and Germany have all announced their second nationwide shutdowns, with restrictions on people’s movement, in an effort to curtail a new wave of covid-19 infections. Europe’s summer of foreign holidays and restaurant dining now seems like a distant memory.</p><p >The virus, which at the start of the second wave in September had been confined mainly to young healthy people in the region, is now spreading to the old and vulnerable. In October, western European countries recorded 4.1m new cases, up from 500,000 in August. What’s more, about 40% of the newly infected people are over 50 years old.</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p >Test-and-trace systems designed to contain the virus until the emergence of a vaccine have been overwhelmed. In the 30 European countries for which data are available, though testing has more than doubled from 1.9m people per day in May to 4.7m in October, it is likely to be insufficient to capture all infected individuals. The share of positive tests has jumped from 3.4% to 7.6% in the past month, a sign that many infections are probably being missed. In Britain, experts reckon that the true number of cases may be two or three times higher than the official tally. England’s contact tracers are overwhelmed. In the week ending October 21st, only 60% of the close contacts of people who tested positive for the virus were reached and asked to self-isolate, well below the government’s 80% target.</p><p >The surge of new cases has caused hospitalisations and deaths to increase, too. Data compiled by <em>The Economist</em> show that hospital admissions for covid-19 across 27 European countries have increased by 125% in the past month. The death toll from this second wave of infections, measured from September 1st onwards, is beginning to resemble the first wave in spring (see chart). Indeed, in Austria, Belgium, England, France and Wales the number of new deaths during the past two months has followed the first wave in near lock-step.</p><p >Some countries have managed to avoid repeating history. In Spain, where cases have remained high since July, deaths have been contained, thanks in part to local restrictions which have been in place for months. Similarly, in Sweden, where cases are now rising rapidly once again, deaths have yet to follow suit. That will be cold comfort to most Europeans. As sure as winter follows autumn, if cases continue to rise, deaths will follow too.</p>
