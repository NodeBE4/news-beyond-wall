We have ambitious plans to develop world-class digital output alongside our long-standing print heritage.</p><p >The audience team is at the heart of this strategy. It publishes content to social-media accounts with nearly 60m followers, through a growing portfolio of newsletters, and via push alerts to our apps. It assists the newsdesk with the management of our website, as well as seeking opportunities to reach new audiences and increase engagement among existing subscribers.</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p >SEO and search are an increasingly important element of <em>The Economist’</em>s digital growth. This new role will identify and implement strategies that maximise the discoverability of our editorial content; ensure we are following best-practice methods across our digital platforms and within our content management systems; and consider sensible onward journeys for visitors who have arrived as a result of such referrals.</p><p >The senior SEO editor will co-ordinate closely on a daily basis with colleagues on the newsdesk and in the wider newsroom. They will liaise with our product team about our technical processes and will be expected to work with the head of audience and digital editor to help develop our wider strategic thinking about engagement.</p><p >We are seeking someone with a significant record of success in digital publishing who understands <em>The Economist</em>’s editorial values and where we fit in the global media landscape. They will be based in our main newsroom in central London, but can be located remotely for now. They must already have the right to live and work in the United Kingdom.</p><p >They will be both an innovative self-starter and a strong team player, with excellent editorial judgment and a keen eye for detail. And they will have a strategy to improve the performance of our award-winning journalism, including headlines, URLs and content management systems, while remaining true to our brand.</p><p >Applicants should submit an assessment of <em>The Economist</em>’s current approach to SEO and search, including a series of recommendations on how we could improve the discoverability and reach of our content.</p><p >This assessment is the most important part of the application, so make sure you present it thoroughly and clearly. We will read it blind (ie. without seeing your name or your experience). Only if what is written fits with what we are looking for will we examine the accompanying CV or resume and consider the rest of your application. You should also include a cover letter that explains why you are the right person for the role.</p><p >All applications or enquiries should be sent to <a href="https://www.economist.commailto:edsocialjob@economist.com">edsocialjob@economist.com</a>.
