To be published in America in May; $27.95</em></p><p data-caps="initial" ><span data-caps="initial">B</span><small>ENIN CITY</small>, or Edo as it was known in its heyday at the start of the 17th century, was a confident metropolis, a place of creativity and military power. In 1600 a Dutch visitor described an impressive central avenue seven or eight times broader than Warmoesstraat, one of the main shopping streets in Amsterdam, and a palace for the Oba<em>,</em> or head of the ruling dynasty, “so large, that you can feel no End”. The walls were decorated with ivory sculptures and elaborate metal plaques depicting hunters, musicians, courtiers and animals including leopards, elephants and crocodiles.</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p >As well as being the heart of a great empire that traded throughout west Africa, Edo was the centre of a complex belief system populated by gods and spirits associated with wealth, health and fertility. Ogun, a god’s son, was said to help the city make tools and weapons; he was (and is) the patron of farmers, fighters, hunters, craftsmen and artists. On attaining the throne, each new Oba would commission a bronze head from the local metal-workers as a way of paying homage to his predecessor. The palace’s shrines and altars to past rulers boasted many of these statues—kings with puffed cheeks and shining eyes, their queens with elaborate collars and tall braided hairpieces.</p><p >Building Edo and its exclaves meant removing 100 times the amount of material contained in the Great Pyramid of Giza, according to an archaeologist who surveyed the area in the 1960s and 1970s. A modern visitor to the city—now the capital of Edo state in southern Nigeria—finds little to show for that effort. The earthen wall that once surrounded the seat of the Oba’s empire is crumbling, littered with human excrement and plastic bags and punctuated by electronic billboards for evangelical churches. The old moat stinks.</p><p >The bronze and ivory treasures are scattered around the world. Some are held by wealthy private collectors in Europe and America—in 2016 the idealised bronze head of a 16th-century royal, with a long-necked calabash sitting on its crown, was sold privately for over $10m. Others are divided between more than 160 museums, chiefly in America, Britain and Germany, which often display them with minimal information. One label euphemistically says the objects were “brought” to Britain after a military skirmish.</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p >How they really got there is a question asked ever more loudly by activists who want Western museums to be more transparent about the origins of their collections. Last November Dan Hicks, a curator at the Pitt Rivers Museum in Oxford, published “The Brutish Museums”, which uses military and trade records to lay out the destruction of the kingdom of Benin by a British expeditionary force in 1897. It shows how colonial expansionism was enlisted in the service of great ethnographic collections (such as the one at the Pitt Rivers), which still draw millions of visitors.</p><p >Western acquisition, though, is only half of the story. One country’s gain is another’s loss. Barnaby Phillips calls his new book “Loot”, a word that came into English usage in 1788 from Hindustani slang for plunder and mayhem. Mr Phillips, a veteran British correspondent in Africa who knows Nigeria well, adds new and much-needed context to the story of the Edo empire and its bloody finale.</p><p >He digs into Edo history to show how the power of the Obas evolved as they encountered the Portuguese, the Dutch and later the British, and tracks what happened to the most important treasures after they were grabbed from theOba’s palace in 1897. The international market took off in the 1930s when some of the British perpetrators of that seizure began selling off their holdings. Counterintuitively, British civil servants worked hard to return the treasures to Nigeria after the second world war, while Nigerian politicians raided their country’s museums for sculptures to use as instruments of diplomacy. In 1973 General Yakubu Gowon gave a rare bronze—looted by the British, then returned to the National Museum of Nigeria in the 1950s—as a gift to Queen Elizabeth when he made his first state visit to Britain. It now sits in the Grand Vestibule at Windsor Castle.</p><h2>Stealers keepers</h2><p >By demonstrating beyond doubt that the Benin bronzes were seized as military booty, in circumstances that would now be described as the “unlawful destruction of cultural heritage” by the <small>UN</small> Security Council, the new accounts make a powerful moral case for their return to Nigeria. Mr Hicks lays bare the savagery of the British expeditionary force. Mr Phillips is at pains to show how deeply the Edo people feel the loss of their physical culture. He describes a scheme in Edo state whereby Sir David Adjaye, architect of the National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington, is to build a new museum and education centre in the city.</p><p >The story of the Benin bronzes is “a dramatic and tragic tale”, Mr Phillips writes. Returning them to a new museum would do a great deal to right a historic wrong. Germany recently indicated that its own museums may soon return their holdings; on March 24th Aberdeen University announced a plan to send an artefact back to Benin City, the first from a British institution for more than half a century. Other British and American museums are expected to follow. But Mr Phillips is clear-sighted about the political and financial obstacles that must still be overcome.</p><p >Young people may be keener on restitution than their forebears, but some Nigerians think money spent on museums would be better directed to schools or hospitals. Others are sceptical about the country’s ability to safeguard its collections. Meanwhile, some in Europe and America would not mind seeing the Nigerians stumble if it meant hanging on to treasures they have long called their own. Possession still has a powerful allure. <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p><p data-test-id="Footnote" >This article appeared in the Books &amp; arts section of the print edition under the headline &quot;The spoils of war&quot;</p>
