On Twitter, Mr Trump announced that “Morocco recognized the United States in 1777. It is thus fitting we recognize their sovereignty over the Western Sahara.” But the annexation is not accepted by most countries, nor by the Polisario Front, which fought Morocco for control of the territory from 1975 to 1991. Polisario, which still controls a third of Western Sahara, is recognised by the United Nations as the legitimate representative of the indigenous Sahrawi people. So, who should control Western Sahara? </p><p >Once known as Spanish Sahara, the area was the last vestige of Spain’s colonial empire. When Spanish troops withdrew in 1975, it became a battlefield with Morocco, Mauritania and Polisario laying claim to the area, rich in lucrative phosphate deposits and fish stocks. Although Mauritania long ago gave up on its claim, withdrawing from the territory in 1979, these economic interests remain an important part of what drives the conflict. Morocco asserts a historical right to control the region dating back to before the Spanish arrived. But the Sahrawi people insist that they have largely governed themselves for hundreds of years, roaming the desert as nomads with ties to no kingdom or state besides their own tribal allegiances. Neither the 16 years of fighting, nor the last 30 years of ceasefire and talks between Morocco and Polisario, has resolved anything. </p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p >The UN tried to help the former colony make a smooth transition from Spanish rule. Several resolutions, passed in the 1960s and 1970s, emphasised that all powers should be transferred to the people being decolonised, “in accordance with their freely expressed will and desire”. This meant consulting the Sahrawis in a referendum. Did they want to join one of their neighbours (Morocco and Mauritania), or seek independence? But the referendum hit an immediate snag when Morocco asked the International Court of Justice (ICJ) to consider its claim over the territory. The judges made sure to temper expectations, emphasising that they were giving a non-binding opinion and not declaring a winner over the territory. First, the court found that Western Sahara was not a <em>terra nullius</em> (nobody’s land) at the time of Spain’s colonisation and belonged to someone. Second, strong, historical ties connected Morocco to the tribes living in Western Sahara. But did this mean it could annex the territory hundreds of years later? Morocco claimed as much, and the court’s decision continues to form the basis of its claim today. </p><div ><figure><div itemscope="" itemProp="image" itemType="https://schema.org/ImageObject" data-slim="1"><meta itemProp="url" content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/625/90/sites/default/files/images/2021/01/blogs/economist-explains/20201212_wom909_0.png"/><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/625/90/sites/default/files/images/2021/01/blogs/economist-explains/20201212_wom909_0.png"  sizes="300px" alt=""/></div></figure><p >To show that Western Sahara formed part of its national territory, Morocco had to produce evidence of authority at the time of Spain’s colonisation and immediately before it. That its then sultan had appointed “caids” (tax collectors) and sheikhs in the territory in the 19th century was not enough to convince the judges. According to Spain, a notable characteristic of the tribes in territory where the sultan had nominal religious and political control was their refusal to be taxed, which made Moroccan authority seem shaky at best. Nor was it decisive that both Morocco and Western Sahara were then part of the Sherifian state, founded on the common religious bond of Islam and the allegiance of various tribes to the sultan. The judges agreed that the sultan displayed authority over some of the tribes in Western Sahara, but they rejected any other “tie of territorial sovereignty”. </p><p >After a round of talks in Madrid, also in 1975, Spain agreed to transfer its responsibilities as administering power to Morocco and Mauritania. Shortly afterwards, Morocco began to “peacefully occupy” the territory. The Sahrawis responded by forming Polisario, which was backed by neighbouring Algeria—Morocco&#x27;s long-standing rival for control of the routes to West Africa. Continued Algerian support for Polisario since 1975, through the provision of financial aid, arms and training, has ensured the liberation movement’s survival. </p><p >But the historical argument has proven largely irrelevant. A war between Morocco and Polisario ended in a ceasefire in 1991, with Morocco in control of about two-thirds of the territory and all its coastline, and Polisario running about a third, on the border with Mauritania. No referendum has taken place, and as time goes on the rationale for holding one weakens. The Moroccan government has steadily increased the presence of Moroccan settlers in Western Sahara, ensuring its authority by sheer numbers. Determining who should be entitled to vote in the referendum has therefore resulted in a 46-year-long deadlock. The original list for voter identification, agreed to by both Morocco and Polisario, says that only citizens featured in the 1974 census of the Western Sahara population and their descendants should be eligible. Morocco wants to let its citizens vote in any referendum. And with Moroccan settlers now accounting for some 80% of Western Sahara’s population, this would lead to a predictable outcome. But even this is unlikely. Morocco has already spent billions developing the region and has no interest in holding a referendum. If Morocco has its way, Western Sahara will be autonomous, not independent. America’s recognition of the fait accompli has made that all but certain. </p></div>
