We pull up like, ‘Who’s with it?’ Load that clip like grrr, finish,” rapped <small>J</small> Emz, a member of OneFour, a Sydney drill crew, in 2019, responding to accusations that the group feigns a British identity to polish its street cred. The threat to mow down critics did not impress Mac11, a member of 21District, a rival crew. “Trying to be <small>UK</small> Bronx, bunch of flops. Do your own thing, you wannabe British gronks.”</p><p >Rappers outside the United States used to sound American. Nowadays, the spread of grime music and <small>UK</small> drill means aping England’s rappers is fashionable. Grime, which uses very rapid beats, emerged in east London in the early 2000s. Drill appeared in Chicago a decade later and soon migrated to Britain, where it got faster and darker. Drake, a prominent Canadian rapper, has borrowed from <small>UK</small> drill and promoted many London rappers.</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p >Crucial to <small>UK</small> drill’s success is multicultural London English (<small>MLE</small>), a dialect that combines Jamaican patois with Cockney, American and African slang, as well as other influences from London’s melting-pot. “Akhi”, from Arabic, is commonly used for “brother”, its direct translation, and also “friend”. “The language comes first from the street,” says Tony Thorne of King’s College London, who has compiled a drill dictionary. “Then the performers elaborate the language, then they feed it back to the street.” <small>MLE</small> has helped English rappers create a distinctive sound, with a controversial social commentary.</p><p >As <small>UK</small> drill has spread around the world, so has <small>MLE</small>. Dutch crew 73 De Pijp mix in words like “mandem” (from Jamaican patois, meaning a group of male friends) and “oppboys” (a London neologism for a rival gang). Spanish crew 970<small>BLOCK</small> use <small>MLE</small> lingo like “you get me” and “gally” and break into English to compare themselves to Headie One, a London <small>MC</small>: “I’m the one like Headie.” Catarrh Nisin, a Japanese grime <small>MC</small>, refers to Boy Better Know, a London grime crew, and raps “Keep it grimy.” Some Irish <small>MC</small>s, such as <small>J</small>.<small>B</small>2, have abandoned their native accents altogether.</p><p ><small>MLE</small> has also crept into Australian drill. OneFour use a range of <small>MLE</small> words, such as “bruddas” (brothers) and “shh” (silence), a term popularised by Headie One in 2018 to self-censor possibly incriminating lyrics. Even 21District use some <small>MLE</small>, despite their criticism of OneFour’s Anglophilia. Many Australian drill <small>MC</small>s are of Polynesian descent and their accents are already different to most young Australians, so a multi-ethnic dialect appeals to them. Australia, like Britain, has tight gun laws and plenty of knife crime, so London’s lingo is more relevant than gun-centric American rap. “Cheffed” (stabbed), “rambo” (long knife) and “ching” (knife) are common. Australian rappers mix <small>MLE</small> with local slang, old Aussie lingo—“digger” (friend), used by Anzac troops in the first world war—and Polynesian—“uso”, Samoan for “brother”.</p><p >Variants of <small>MLE</small> have emerged in other English cities, even among young middle-class folk. The same thing is starting to happen in Australia. Kate Burridge, professor of linguistics at Monash University in Melbourne, notes that her teenage son jokingly uses <small>MLE</small> words such as “mandem”. Her colleague Howard Manns says some young Australians use “peng” to mean attractive or high-quality. It is thought to derive from “kushempeng”—fantastic marijuana, in Jamaican patois.<span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p><p data-test-id="Footnote" >This article appeared in the Britain section of the print edition under the headline &quot;Learning the drill&quot;</p>
