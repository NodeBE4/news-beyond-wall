Days later, he was Kyrgyzstan’s prime minister and acting president, following his country’s third revolution in 15 years. Mr Japarov got his big break after allies of the previous president, Sooronbay Jeyenbekov, reportedly decided to buy votes in a parliamentary election (at around $25 a vote). But although pro-government parties duly succeeded in snaffling 107 of the 120 available seats, they badly misjudged how Kyrgyzstani people would react. Large crowds took to the streets to denounce the suspected swindle. But what began as genuine democratic protests somehow metamorphosed into a power grab—and a remarkable change in circumstances for Kyrgyzstan’s most fortunate convict.</p><p >Kyrgyzstan is often referred to as Central Asia’s only democracy. But it is battered by poverty and graft, its democratic values most often expressed through protest. In 2005 and 2010 anger at corrupt government also sent people onto the streets. This time, opportunists were ready to seize upon the confusion. Opposition groups took over government buildings, President Jeyenbekov fled, and Mr Japarov’s supporters sprung him and other political figures from prison. Things moved quickly after that. Mr Japarov secured sufficient nominations from lawmakers to become prime minister, before Mr Jeyenbekov’s resignation and the parliamentary speaker’s subsequent decision not to take up the chance to lead the country, propelled Mr Japarov to the (acting) presidency. </p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p >Kyrgyzstan’s new leader is a rabble-rouser popular with many Kyrgyzstanis. From behind bars, Mr Japarov developed the biggest social-media following of any domestic politician. Supporters view him as a hero, unjustly punished for pushing for the nationalisation of a Canadian-owned gold mine in 2013. It is then that he is said to have orchestrated the hostage-taking of a local official (his conviction for kidnapping is now being speedily reviewed by the Supreme Court). </p><p >Critics, however, are not convinced, particularly by his promise to free Kyrgyzstani politics from organised crime. Last year journalists exposed a money-laundering scheme in which nearly $1bn, some of it apparently the proceeds of smuggling goods from China, was spirited out of Kyrgyzstan, a country whose annual GDP is just $8bn. Raimbek Matraimov, the influential former deputy head of the customs service, allegedly played a part and was questioned by police, albeit as a witness rather than as a suspect. (He denies any wrongdoing.) Within days of assuming power, Mr Japarov formed an anti-corruption body and arrested Mr Matraimov, only to release him shortly afterwards. Mr Matraimov was released into house arrest and with the promise that $24m in illicit proceeds would be repaid. Still, some considered the original arrest to be window-dressing intended to obscure Mr Japarov’s own rumoured connections to crime (rumours which Mr Japarov denies). The move came days after several lawmakers alleged that criminals had pressed them into voting for Mr Japarov. </p><p >The political intrigues of a country with fewer than 7m people may seem marginal to many, but they could have wider consequences. Recent events are a blow to parliamentary democracy in Kyrgyzstan and to its reputation in the region. Mr Japarov’s nationalist affiliations also risk aggravating ethnic tensions. One of his first actions as prime minister was to announce that an ethnicity section would be added once more to Kyrgyzstani passports. Filling it in is optional, but it could accentuate ethnic divisions. The previous time a president was toppled, more than 400 people were killed in the resulting violence, mainly members of the Uzbek minority. On a positive note, perhaps, the alarmed reactions of the big regional powers suggest that there was no outside meddling. China is concerned by protesters taking aim at Chinese-owned gold mines. Russia, protective of its military base in the ex-Soviet country, wants a stable regional partner. For Kyrgyzstan’s people, though, any loss of foreign investment would further weaken an economy hit hard by shrivelling remittances from Russia and rising unemployment. It may be a very difficult winter.</p>
