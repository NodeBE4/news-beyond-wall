It should have been a chance to relax but as we ate, I couldn’t help wondering whether it was a good idea for the two of us to be sitting indoors within viral range of other unmasked diners who were chatting, laughing and opening their gaping maws. What was the ventilation scenario? How quickly could we make good our escape from this potentially hazardous situation? Between these anxious distractions and my son’s monomaniacal focus on his pizza, we didn’t talk much. But at one point, he took an unhurried draft of his beverage, leaned back in his seat, looked at me with an expression of unclouded satisfaction and told me that this was the greatest night of his life. The fact that it was shortly after 5pm only added potency to his declaration.</p><p >My son has a tendency to register his pleasures in the superlative. If he’s enjoying a meal or a film, he will often make a point of announcing that it’s the best he’s ever eaten or seen. Even so, I found myself particularly affected by his pronouncement in the restaurant, because I knew that he wasn’t referring to the pizza or even the more general pandemic-era novelty of eating out. What he was really saying was “look at the two of us, getting out of the house and spending time together”.</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p >He has recently developed vocabulary for talking about such things. At some point in the past few months he has added the expression “quality time” to his lexicon. When asked what he means by this, he typically mentions an activity he would like to do with one of his parents that doesn’t involve his sister. Where his mother is concerned, the go-to example is miniature golf. Last summer, she took him to the suburbs to visit a rainforest-themed miniature golf establishment, an experience that has since come to represent for him the gold standard of quality time.</p><figure data-image-nozoom="true"><div itemscope="" itemProp="image" itemType="https://schema.org/ImageObject"><meta itemProp="url" content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/1287/90/1843magazine.com/sites/default/files/1843_20210129_UF_CTQUALITYTIME_002.jpg"/><img loading="lazy" width="1280" height="1287" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/1287/90/1843magazine.com/sites/default/files/1843_20210129_UF_CTQUALITYTIME_002.jpg"  sizes="(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw" alt=""/></div></figure><p >My son picked up the concept from a school friend who also has a younger sibling, and who seems to have imparted its usefulness as a means to leverage parental guilt. He finds the phrase useful because it provides conceptual scaffolding to his complaints about the overall standard of parenting he’s receiving. On a number of occasions lately, he has grumbled that he is not getting enough “quality time” with either of us. (One effect of a global pandemic is that it dramatically reduces the opportunity for indoor novelty-golf experiences.)</p><p >By the time his little sister was born, my son had had five full years of being an only child. In the two and a half years since then he has tried to reconcile his unconscious sense of himself as the sole rightful focus of our attention with the presence of a toddler who begs to differ. I don’t think it’s personal, because he loves his sister very much. But he often seems to long for a return to the prelapsarian state of undivided parental affection.</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p data-caps="initial" ><span data-caps="initial">T</span>he phrase “quality time” arose in the late 1970s, but Google’s Ngram Viewer (an internet tool that maps the shifting usage of phrases over time by mining millions of digitised books) suggests that it didn’t really take off until the 1980s and 1990s. Its spread coincided with epochal trends in the English-speaking world – the dominance of neoliberal economics, longer working hours, an increase in the number of middle-class families with two working parents – which meant that many parents had less time to spend with their children.</p><p >The expression performs an interesting evaluative sleight-of-hand whereby we’re made to believe that it’s not how much time we are with each other that counts, but what we do with that time. I’ve spent enough hours slumped on the couch beside my children, staring at my phone while they watch cartoons, to know that quality time is a laudable goal. But it serves the interests of employers more than families, suggesting that it’s ok to be absent from your kids so long as you’re giving them short bursts of highly focused attention.</p><blockquote><p>My son finds the phrase “quality time” useful because it provides conceptual scaffolding to his complaints about the overall standard of parenting he’s receiving</p></blockquote><p >Despite my ideological distrust of the concept, it does seem to point towards a significant truth. I’ve been working at home for almost a year now, so I’m around far more than I used to be. True, for a lot of the time I’m holed up in the spare room, writing or finding ways to avoid it (“Sorry, I’m going to have to refer you to your mother here, because I’ve a parenting column to write”). But I’m definitely around. If anything I’m too much around. I have no scarcity value anymore. And I’ve noticed a qualitative difference between our experience of just hanging around the house together, and what happens when we make a decision to “do something”.</p><figure data-image-nozoom="true"><div itemscope="" itemProp="image" itemType="https://schema.org/ImageObject"><meta itemProp="url" content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/1278/90/1843magazine.com/sites/default/files/1843_20210129_UF_CTQUALITYTIME_003.jpg"/><img loading="lazy" width="1280" height="1278" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/1278/90/1843magazine.com/sites/default/files/1843_20210129_UF_CTQUALITYTIME_003.jpg"  sizes="(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw" alt=""/></div></figure><p >In the ordinary run of things our exchanges are distracted and frequently tetchy. Half of my dealings with my son revolve around trying to convince him to do things he doesn’t want to do – getting dressed in the morning, eating his meals, turning off the <small>TV</small>, getting ready for bed. It often feels like the rest of our interactions involve the reverse: him trying to cajole me into playing with Lego, mostly. But when we leave the house to “do something” together, even if it’s just for a ramble around the neighbourhood, a subtle but immediate change occurs. Frankly, it’s not even that subtle. We have actual conversations, in which neither of us seems interested in getting the other to do anything apart from talk.</p><p >Though I might want our relationship to subsist purely on love, it is usually defined by a shifting power dynamic. But for the circumscribed period of time in which we are “doing something”, that power dynamic fades into momentary irrelevance. So much of parenting is labour, working to get your children from one end of the day to the next. Home is a place where there is always work, of one sort or another, to be done – even more so these days when we’re all “working from home” on top of each other. The blurring of lines doesn’t leave much space for the delicious joy of getting one of your parents all to yourself.</p><figure data-image-nozoom="true"><div itemscope="" itemProp="image" itemType="https://schema.org/ImageObject"><meta itemProp="url" content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/1289/90/1843magazine.com/sites/default/files/1843_20210129_UF_CTQUALITYTIME_004.jpg"/><img loading="lazy" width="1280" height="1289" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/1289/90/1843magazine.com/sites/default/files/1843_20210129_UF_CTQUALITYTIME_004.jpg"  sizes="(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw" alt=""/></div></figure><p >I often had fun with my siblings, but some of my happiest childhood memories are of spending time alone with my parents. When I was at primary school I had music lessons near where my father worked. I would walk there afterwards and wait for him to finish so that we could go home together. Often my dad would decide that we should slip into the pub round the corner for a quick drink first. We’d sit at the bar – him with his pint and me with my coke and packet of crisps – and we would talk. I don’t remember what we chatted about, only that it was just the two of us, and we were talking. Those evenings were wonderful to me even then, and have come to seem increasingly precious since, as my father has grown older and I have become the father of a little boy nearing the age that I would have been then. They were, probably, the greatest evenings of my life.</p><blockquote><p>He looked at me with an expression of unclouded satisfaction and told me this was the greatest night of his life</p></blockquote><p >The last time I went to the pub was in February. I took my son to our local on a whim one weekend afternoon. It wasn’t something we’d ever done before. I had a pint, and he had a coke and a packet of crisps, and we sat at a table and talked. I don’t remember what we talked about, only that it was just the two of us, and we were talking. A few weeks ago, I asked him what he’d like to do once we’d all had the vaccine and were finally free. He had a lot of ideas but I remember two in particular. He wanted to play miniature golf with his mum. And he wanted to go to the pub with me for a coke and a packet of crisps.<span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p><p >ILLUSTRATIONS: <strong>KLAUS KREMMERZ</strong></p>
