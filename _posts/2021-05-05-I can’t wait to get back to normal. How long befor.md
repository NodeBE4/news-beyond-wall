It was not as expected. The Arcadia I imagined was all rolling green hills and verdant woods in which shepherds played their pipes and cross-dressing lovers lounged about on the grass. Arcadia, Kansas, was nothing like that: it was a tiny dot in a great sea of prairie flatness, under a hard blue sky.</p><p >This Arcadia had two red-brick storefronts, long abandoned, which were covered with ivy and leaning into the street; a few living stores, including a café with tired net curtains; and a shopfront with the words “City Hall” painted above the windows. Outside it, two middle-aged women were struggling to get the Stars and Stripes to half-mast on a tricky new flagpole, advised or obstructed by two plump young men in a pick-up truck that was parked in the middle of the street. Maybe I was the only other car that passed through Arcadia that day.</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p >America’s pioneers, heading relentlessly west in their lumbering wagons, were easily excited. I also visited Eureka, Kansas, and apparently went through Climax too, though I never noticed. Any place that was halfway comfortable or sheltered, with grazing and water, was immediately hailed as the promised land. This was it: somewhere they could at last stop, settle and get on with the rest of their lives. Just like that place called Normal, for which we now all supposedly sigh.</p><p >You can go direct to Normal, if you like. You will find that most of the five Normals in America are tiny unincorporated places given their name not for their deep ordinariness, but because they once had a teacher-training college, or “normal school”.</p><blockquote><p>“Normal” is an adjective that now aches and glows, like the mythical Golden Age</p></blockquote><p >The biggest Normal, next to Bloomington, Illinois, has the state university, a bowling alley and a nearby skating rink, as well as a farm that makes cheese. In March, the main draw at the Normal Theatre was “The Quiet Man”. Normal, Indiana, began life as Slash, a glittering knife whirl of excitement, before becoming dull again. I have not visited these smaller Normals, but I presume that each has neither too much traffic nor too little; as many shops as are needed, and no more; an equable style of weather, requiring just a thin coat; and a midway position in all statistical tables.</p><p data-caps="initial" ><span data-caps="initial">N</span>ormal can only be dull: that is its nature. No alarums, no excursions. The word had a little more edge in ancient Rome, when it meant “exactly made, according to a carpenter’s square”. That edge has long been lost (together with its image of the patient craftsman, getting the porch of Pliny’s country place absolutely straight). Normal came to mean standard and acceptable. No wonder it entered general parlance not long after the devil-may-care Regency gave way to Victorian decorum.</p><figure data-image-nozoom="true"><div itemscope="" itemProp="image" itemType="https://schema.org/ImageObject"><meta itemProp="url" content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/1280/90/1843magazine.com/sites/default/files/1843_20210505_ST-NORMAL_002.jpg"/><img loading="lazy" width="1280" height="1280" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/1280/90/1843magazine.com/sites/default/files/1843_20210505_ST-NORMAL_002.jpg"  sizes="(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw" alt=""/></div></figure><p >In recent months the word normal has acquired an allure it never had before. “Normal” is an adjective that now aches and glows, like the mythical Golden Age, or the shining towers and fountains of Shangri-La. Our attitude to it, though, is usually more complex.</p><p >To be told that a baby is normal is comforting. You want your blood pressure or pulse to be normal. Yet to hear that weather is “normal for the time of year”, or that a child’s skills are “normal for her age” brings a sharp prick of disappointment. So, no genius then? And no bragging rights for having endured burst pipes in that sudden cold snap? As for normal waiting times, or interest rates, that lurk in small print everywhere, a smell of cynicism hangs around them, and the shadow of faceless people waiting to trick us.</p><p >When it comes to ourselves, we know we are not normal. Our heads buzz and jump with ideas never before thought of, schemes no one else would suspect. The very idea of normalising human lives is an outrage. “Why can’t you be normal?!” cried one of our teachers when my schoolfriend Margaret, long red hair streaming, threw herself wildly off the stage while playing Lady Macbeth. “Because I can’t,” the winded child replied.</p><blockquote><p>Even as we adjust to Normal again, we will be packing our bags to escape it</p></blockquote><p >The latest motto of Brighton, the let-it-all-hang-out seaside city where I live, is “Never Normal”; it is painted in pink and purple swirls on a basketball court overlooking the best-loved landmark in the city, the burned-out skeleton of the West Pier. The Body Shop now tells customers that “normal skin is anything but normal; [it] could be extraordinary”, and Unilever has removed the word “normal” from all its beauty products, acknowledging that the idea of a normal body is absurd.</p><p >The most famous evocation of normality was made by Warren Harding, when he riffed on the odious word “normalcy” in his presidential campaign in 1920 : “Not agitation, but adjustment; not surgery, but serenity; not the dramatic, but the dispassionate; not experiment, but equipoise.” But that came after a dramatic and terrible war, not a blank and dreary lockdown. Harding (who won) might not get many votes for normalcy now. Yes to shopping, hugging, having friends to stay, going to the pub and the theatre, dropping the masks and people-dodging – and what then?</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p >We want our times to be interesting; we scan our phones constantly for excitement; we dream of holidays where the sights are strange, the food exotic, the sunshine and pools infinite, and our unsuspected selves thrillingly unleashed. One lockdown treat offered in Normal, Illinois, was the chance to train as a home-based travel agent. A number of people have probably done the course now. Even as we adjust to Normal again, we will be packing our bags to escape it. How about a trip to Arcadia?<span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p><p ><strong>Ann Wroe</strong> is <em>The Economist</em>’s obituaries editor</p><p >ILLUSTRATIONS: <strong>ANTONELLO SILVERINI</strong></p>
