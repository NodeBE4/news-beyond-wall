Opponents worried that it would tilt the nation towards “vile and arbitrary aristocracy or monarchy”.</p><p >The anti-federalists, it seems, were right to be concerned. On December 22nd and 23rd President Donald Trump put his signature on nearly 50 eyebrow-raising pardons and commutations. The beneficiaries included his longtime confidant, Roger Stone; his campaign manager, Paul Manafort; and several others prosecuted as part of Robert Mueller’s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. Others were Charles Kushner, Ivanka Trump’s father-in-law who spent two years in prison for witness tampering and tax evasion; three former Republican members of Congress convicted of fraud and financial misdeeds; and military contractors responsible for killing unarmed civilians during the Iraq war. Removing these figures from the naughty list sets the 45th president apart from his predecessors. In the eyes of Ben Sasse, a Republican senator from Nebraska, the pardons are “rotten to the core”—and Mr Trump still has nearly a month to go in the White House.</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p >Article II, section 2, clause 1 of the constitution affords presidents a wide berth in granting clemency. The only limit noted in the text is a bar on pardons in the case of impeachments. Over the years courts have leaned toward an expansive reading of the power: in 1866, the Supreme Court said pardons may be offered prior to an individual’s conviction or even indictment, and no ruling has prohibited presidents from extending mercy to friends or family members. But protocols and norms have guided the process. A body within the Department of Justice—the office of the pardon attorney—assists presidents in deciding to whom they should extend mercy. The pardon attorney assesses candidates according to criteria such as “post-conviction conduct, character and reputation”, “acceptance of responsibility, remorse and atonement” and “official recommendations and reports” from federal prosecutors or judges. Yet Mr Trump has taken the task on largely by himself: he has opted to bypass the office for all but a few of his pardons. </p><p >Presidents have often employed the pardon power in line with Hamilton’s hopes. George Washington pardoned the unsuccessful Whiskey rebels (spirits producers who rioted against a tax on their goods) in 1795. Abraham Lincoln pardoned many Confederates during the Civil War in 1863 to encourage them to give up their drive towards secession and chart a path for the union’s reconstruction. Gerald Ford’s pardon of Richard Nixon after he resigned the presidency and Jimmy Carter’s pardon of Vietnam War draft-dodgers were in a similar mould: helping the nation heal after a period of trauma. Barack Obama commuted the sentences of more than 1,000 inmates serving time for mostly non-violent drug offences.</p><p >In contrast, Mr Trump’s pardons look more dubious. Roger Stone, the president’s colourful, Nixon-tattooed adviser, received a commutation of his prison sentence in July for lying to Congress and obstructing the Russia investigation to protect Mr Trump; he got a full pardon on December 23rd. Paul Manafort, who initially co-operated with the Mueller investigation before lying to prosecutors, showed enough loyalty to attract Mr Trump’s sympathy. George Papadopoulos, an early target of Mr Mueller’s investigation, admitted his crimes and acknowledged to a judge that his lies to federal agents “could have harmed our nation”. In justifying his pardons of these and other figures pursued by Mr Mueller, Mr Trump referred to the Russia investigation as a “hoax” and as the “greatest witch hunt in American history”. He used his Article II power to try to discredit and nullify the fruits of the nearly two-year-long investigation that dogged his presidency and led to an impeachment inquiry.</p><p >He offered a similarly thin rationale for coming to the rescue of Dustin Heard, Evan Liberty, Nicholas Slatten and Paul Slough, four former contractors at Blackwater, a private security company founded by Erik Prince, the brother of Betsy Devos, Mr Trump’s education secretary. The men had been found guilty of killing at least 14 Iraqis, including two children, in 2007. Mr Trump praised the quartet for their “long history of service to the nation”, noted support for their pardons by Republican congressmen like Steve King of Iowa and Louie Gohmert of Texas, and raised doubts about one of the witnesses used to convict Mr Slatten. But the indiscriminate shooting, grenade-throwing and sniper fire into Baghdad’s crowded Nisour Square was widely condemned internationally and dubbed the “My Lai massacre of Iraq” by FBI investigators.</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p >Mr Trump is hardly the only recent president to take liberties with the pardon power. On his way out of office in 1992, George H. W. Bush pardoned six people involved in the Iran-Contra scandal he had overseen as Ronald Reagan’s vice president. Bill Clinton drew criticism across the political spectrum when he pardoned Marc Rich, a billionaire fugitive tax-evader who raised millions for the Democratic party and whose wife contributed nearly $500,000 to Mr Clinton’s presidential library.</p><p >But no president comes close to Mr Trump’s ratio of self-serving pardons to those issued in the interest of mercy or national welfare. By the estimation of Jack Goldsmith, a Harvard law professor tracking the pardons, only seven of the 94 pardons and commutations he has issued over the course of his presidency seemed to have been recommended by the pardon attorney. And as many as 86 of the 94 were “aberrant”—aimed to advance Mr Trump’s political agenda, or based on a personal connection or pushed by celebrity figures such as boxers and Fox News commentators. For Jed Shugerman, a professor at Fordham law school, the character of Mr Trump’s pardons is “utterly unprecedented”.</p><p >Few are surprised at Mr Trump’s unconventional use of his pardon power. With weeks left in his presidency, he is hemmed in by the courts on many of his endeavours—among them ending Barack Obama’s protections for young immigrants, battling sanctuary cities’ attempts to stymie immigration enforcement, adding a citizenship question to the census and raising legal challenges to his electoral loss. Mr Trump seems to enjoy this apparently kingly power beyond the judiciary’s purview.</p><p >Yet for a presidency that, from its inception, has pushed boundaries of executive power and bulldozed norms of proper government, America may see still more audacious pardons in the days ahead; some ask whether they will include the president’s children and possibly even Mr Trump himself. Mr Shugerman warns that the pardon power is “not absolute”. It must be exercised in line with other constitutional rules such as equal protection and the requirement that presidents “faithfully execute” the laws.</p><p >No president has tried to pardon himself, and no structure exists to stop him from signing such an order. But if he were to issue America’s first presidential self-pardon, he may face a court test after the fact—spurring a Supreme Court battle over an act that directly contravenes Hamilton’s rationale for such authority. Legal questions may also arise if Mr Trump issues pardons to close associates for offences that are not fully spelled out. If he wants to insulate his pardons from legal attack, Mr Trump would need to be specific about his advisers’ or family members’ acts that could be subject to criminal inquiry. Yet airing those details could be an incriminating, or at least a highly embarrassing, move. They would remove the recipients&#x27; 5th amendment right not to incriminate themselves—and may be particularly troublesome if some recipients, like Ivanka Trump, one day chose to run for office.</p>
