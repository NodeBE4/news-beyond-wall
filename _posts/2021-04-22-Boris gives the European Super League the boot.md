No sooner had six British clubs announced their plan to form a breakaway league with top European clubs than the government swung into action. Mr Johnson arranged a summit in Downing Street to discuss ways of scuppering the scheme. Angry Tory <small>MP</small>s suggested possible punishments for miscreants: a windfall tax on the breakaway clubs, fewer work permits to prevent the signing of players from abroad, unleashing competition law, withdrawing police support from matches and introducing a German-style ownership structure whereby fans own a controlling 51% of the clubs.</p><p >The Super League, a soufflé of arrogance and greed, quickly collapsed under sustained assault from government and fans. Ed Woodward, the Manchester United executive widely thought to be at the heart of the scheme, resigned. But despite its speedy demise the fracas reveals something significant about the Conservative Party’s changing attitudes to business, markets and globalisation.</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p >In the Thatcher era the Conservatives acted as cheerleaders to the money-fuelled transformation of a game that had become synonymous with dilapidated stands and hooliganism. The most famous teams such as Liverpool and Manchester United became global brands with a rising number of foreign players and fans. Foreign billionaires bought storied clubs despite having no roots in the cities that gave birth to them. Millionaire players and their wives and girlfriends set the era’s vulgar tone. The rickety old stadiums were replaced by American-style arenas but the skyrocketing cost of tickets priced poorer fans out of the game.</p><p >Mr Johnson approved of this transformation as recently as 2005 when he pronounced that allowing the sale of Manchester United to the Glazer brothers, American sports entrepreneurs, was “basic Conservative philosophy”. But this week he played a very different tune, reprimanding the “billionaire club owners” for dislocating football from its host communities. In an article in the <em>Sun</em>—a newspaper owned by Rupert Murdoch, who did as much as anybody to drive the commercialisation of the game, and once tried to buy Manchester United—he told fans: “It is your game, and you can rest assured that I’m going to do everything I can to give this ludicrous plan a straight red.”</p><p >Mr Johnson’s thumbs-down reveals a profound change in the Conservative Party: the return of the business-scepticism that Edward Heath expressed when he decried “the unacceptable face of capitalism”. Mr Johnson has long since sloughed off his Thatcherism and now supports a more strategic approach to business, sometimes befriending business people—particularly supporters of Brexit like Sir James Dyson—but sometimes showing them the cold shoulder. He supports an ambitious programme of state intervention to “level up” the country and name-checks Michael Heseltine, Thatcher’s most formidable critic, as one of his heroes, citing, in particular, his regeneration of Liverpool. Carrie Symonds, his girlfriend, is a fan of all things green, even if that means sacrificing growth. A new generation of northern Tory <small>MP</small>s constantly speaks up in Parliament on the plight of small-town Britain. Danny Kruger, a former adviser to Mr Johnson, made a memorable maiden speech in which he argued that “social infrastructure” should be treated as seriously as “economic infrastructure”.</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p >It is tempting to blame this shift on Brexit. The business establishment campaigned to stay in the European Union, and Tory Brexiteers discovered the pleasures of business-bashing, memorably encapsulated in Mr Johnson’s succinct “fuck business”. The 2017 Tory manifesto rejected “untrammelled free markets” and the “cult of selfish individualism”, lauding instead the “institutions that bind us together” and “the good that government can do”. But in truth the shift had begun well before the referendum. A growing number of Tories worried that Margaret Thatcher had tried to produce a country in the image of her father, a hard-working shopkeeper, and had instead produced one in the image of her son, a low-achieving spiv. Some were ashamed of the impact on Britain’s traditional working class which, according to Ferdinand Mount, who ran Thatcher’s Policy Unit, was “subjected to a sustained programme of social contempt and institutional erosion”.</p><p >The Conservative Party has always had a powerful communitarian tradition. Obscured by Thatcher (who was in many ways a Manchester School liberal rather than a Tory), it is thriving once again. Edmund Burke lamented that “the age of chivalry” was gone and that of “sophists, economists and calculators” had arisen. Benjamin Disraeli attacked Robert Peel’s decision to repeal the Corn Laws on the grounds that it would dissolve the feudal ties that kept Britain together. The ensuing split consigned the party to two decades in the wilderness. Stanley Baldwin dressed as a tweedy squire and denounced “hard-faced men who look as if they had done very well out of the war”. Harold Macmillan, the son of a publisher who married a daughter of the Duke of Devonshire, preferred the feudal nexus to the cash nexus. John Major, in his faltering attempt to break with his predecessor, summoned up images of long shadows on country cricket grounds and old maids bicycling to Holy Communion through the morning mist.</p><p >Today’s Tory communitarians are different from their predecessors. They focus on post-industrial towns rather than mist-enveloped villages. They treat the working class rather than the landed aristocracy as the embodiment of community spirit. They are football Tories rather than cricket Tories. But they use the same weapons: an appeal to “one nation”, suspicion of the global market, nostalgia for the world before money-grubbing tore society apart, and an ability to run hot and cold on business, sometimes praising and sometimes savaging it. The football tycoons to whom Mr Johnson has given the boot will not be the last capitalists to feel the power of this new form of populist communitarianism. <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p><p data-test-id="Footnote" >This article appeared in the Britain section of the print edition under the headline &quot;Football Tories&quot;</p><br><hr><div>获取更多RSS：<br><a href="https://feedx.net" style="color:orange" target="_blank">https://feedx.net</a> <br><a href="https://feedx.top" style="color:orange" target="_blank">https://feedx.top</a><br></div>
