She is also a scam artist. The first insight is doled out by Marla herself in an impassioned voiceover minutes into “I Care A Lot”, a dark, bitingly funny new film written and directed by J⁠ Blakeson, whose previous credits include “The Disappearance of Alice Creed” and “Gunpowder”. The second viewers soon work out for themselves.</p><p >The con works like this. Marla (Rosamund Pike, pictured right) runs a flourishing guardianship firm. It is a notionally kosher commercial service, but it specialises in finding wealthy, elderly people with unscrupulous doctors. She pays the doctors to help her establish the case for guardianship in court and once she has legal control, she swoops in, packs her charges off to care homes and auctions off their assets, all while siphoning off healthy profit margins. In court, and to the broader public, she smoothly talks the talk of the caring professional. “Remember, I’m on your side,” she croons. “I’m here to help.” Colleagues and the viewer know better. “What?” She cries in horror upon learning one elderly man under her care has died. “I only had him six months, I thought he’d last us another five years...Now we’ll have to cash him out.”</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p >The point is never explicitly made, but the implication is that this scheme runs so smoothly because Marla seems to represent the kind of entrepreneurial, “girlboss” success story society so enjoys. Marla is female, gay, whip-smart, unapologetic and beautiful. She wears bright suits and fashionable shoes. When attacked, she wields the language of victimhood like a blade. “Does it hurt more because I’m a woman?” She asks a man she has just squashed in court. In any other film, this kind of moment would call for a righteous cheer. Instead, the viewer waits for her to meet her match.</p><p >At first glance, Jennifer Paterson (Dianne Wiest, pictured middle) looks like Marla’s other charges⁠. (Marla has a photo wall of them in her chic start-up office, like the trophies of a serial killer.) In her 60s, Jennifer wears cardigans and likes aqua aerobics classes. She is very wealthy, has no family to speak of and is showing signs of memory loss—the perfect victim. But from the moment Marla goes in and pulls off what appears to be the richest coup of her career, it is evident there is rather more to this lady than meets the eye. Jennifer, now imprisoned in a senior living centre and groggy from all the medication Marla insists she be administered, grins crookedly up at her tormentor. “I’m the worst mistake you’ll ever make.”</p><p >She may just be right. It turns out a local mafia boss, played with sinister aplomb by Peter Dinklage, will stop at nothing to protect Jennifer. A tit-for-tat that starts with gamesmanship, threats and legal wrangling quickly turns violent, even deadly. And it is at this moment, unfortunately, that the film descends into outright silliness. Disguises, tasers, henchmen, kidnappings, counter-attacks and general mayhem are piled atop another at dizzying speed.</p><p >It may not matter too much. “I Care A Lot” is stylish and vicious, laced with venomous humour delivered by an excellent cast. Mr Blakeson, a relative newcomer, handles the material with the flair of a far more experienced director. Ms Pike, veteran of countless icy roles, is superb as the film’s greedy, cruel and totally amoral antiheroine. “I own you,” she tells Jennifer, vape-smoke shooting out of her nose in a double jet like a dragon. “And I will drain you of your money, your comfort and your self-respect.” The viewer believes her and hates her, yet urges her on. Marla is too nasty to live but much too fun to watch die.</p><p ><em>“I Care A Lot” is streaming on Netflix in America and Amazon Prime Video in Britain now</em></p>
