We try to understand what is happening in the present and to predict what might happen next, sometimes too confidently. Looking back is worthwhile, though, because in America 2020 packed a decade’s worth of history into its allotted months, and because reflecting on what we got right and wrong in 2020 is good preparation for starting anew in 2021.</p><p >When the year began our focus was on the early stages of the Democratic primary and on President Donald Trump’s forthcoming <a href="https://www.economist.com/united-states/2020/01/07/republicans-agree-on-rules-for-the-senate-trial-of-donald-trump">impeachment trial</a> in the Senate. The Democratic majority in the House had already impeached Mr Trump. With a Republican majority in the Senate it was <a href="https://www.economist.com/leaders/2020/01/23/americas-anything-goes-presidency">all but certain</a> that he would be acquitted. Like so much else during his presidency, the Senate trial was both historic (Mr Trump was only the third president to be subjected to one) and inconsequential (in that it was a foregone conclusion). There was a lot of commentary at the time about what effects the trial might have when voters were asked to pick a new president later in the year. In retrospect it is hard to discern any effect at all.</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p >At the beginning of January Qassem Suleimani, the head of Iran’s Revolutionary Guards’ Quds Force, was <a href="https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2020/01/03/iran-vows-vengeance-after-america-kills-qassem-suleimani">killed</a> by an American drone near Baghdad airport. For all his love of confrontation, President Trump had so far been reluctant to use American military power in foreign adventures. This was a departure from that approach. Assassinating Suleimani, a high-ranking member of the government of a sovereign state who had been responsible for terrorist attacks in the West, was also legally different from assassinating the leader of a terrorist group. Might America get <a href="https://www.economist.com/leaders/2020/01/09/donald-trump-wants-to-curb-iran-has-he-gone-about-it-the-right-way">sucked into a cycle of retaliation</a> with Iran that the president had not anticipated? At times the old foes appeared to come close to military action, but then stepped back.</p><p >Meanwhile the Democratic Party was choosing its candidate to challenge Mr Trump in November. Here the big question was whether the party would follow its usual pragmatism, picking the moderate who seemed best placed to win, or whether the president had enraged Democratic primary voters so much that they might pick Bernie Sanders. At the beginning of February we crunched the numbers and concluded that, for all his flaws, Joe Biden was <a href="https://www.economist.com/united-states/2020/02/01/who-will-be-donald-trumps-most-forceful-foe">clearly the party’s strongest candidate</a>.</p><p >The voters of Iowa and New Hampshire felt differently. Our US editor remembers standing in a small hall in Muscatine, Iowa, on the snowy bank of the Mississippi, and watching Mr Biden spend a sedate couple of hours with 20 or so Iowa caucus-goers and concluding he was unlikely to win the first state. But he did worse than not win: he barely scraped fourth place, just ahead of Amy Klobuchar.</p><p >If we did a good job of picking Mr Biden out of the line-up as the Democrats’ strongest candidate, <a href="https://www.economist.com/united-states/2020/03/01/a-big-win-in-south-carolina-rekindles-joe-bidens-presidential-hopes">his comeback win in South Carolina</a> took us by surprise. At the time, the various moderates in the field (Pete Buttigieg, Ms Klobuchar, Mr Biden, Michael Bloomberg) seemed intent on re-running the Republican primary of 2016, in which John Kasich, Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz and Jeb Bush split the primary vote to allow Mr Trump to win the nomination with only around 25-35% of the vote in the three early states. Might Senator Sanders, who had the consistent backing of about 25% of primary voters, pull-off the same trick that Mr Trump had in 2016?</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p >By the end of February we had put covid-19 on the cover with the headline <a href="https://www.economist.com/leaders/2020/02/27/the-virus-is-coming">“It’s going global”</a>. In ordinary circumstances, we reckoned Mr Trump would beat Mr Sanders comfortably in a head-to-head. But covid-19 was starting to send the economy into freefall. Might a virus that probably emerged from a wet-market in Wuhan put a self-declared socialist into the White House? In the end, South Carolina’s voters put an end to that possibility, and provided a timely reminder of the anchoring role moderate African-American voters play in the Democratic coalition.</p><p >From South Carolina onwards it was clear that November would see a Trump-Biden election. In May <a href="https://www.economist.com/united-states/2020/05/02/we-spent-the-lockdown-sorting-american-voters-into-380000-distinct-groups">we wrote a piece</a> looking forward to that:</p><blockquote><p>Whereas Mrs Clinton lost the election by small margins in Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania, we find Mr Biden with a slight lead in all three. He is also likely to beat Mrs Clinton’s margin in Arizona, which is likelier than any of the midwestern battlegrounds to tip the election.</p><p>That is despite Mr Biden faring relatively poorly with non-white voters and with younger ones. YouGov’s data suggest that African-Americans favour Mr Biden over Mr Trump by a 72-percentage-point margin. That sounds impressive—yet Mrs Clinton won the same group by 80 points. Hispanics, too, have shifted away from the Democrats. Whereas Mrs Clinton won them by 38 points, they now say they will vote for Mr Biden by 28. In other words, Mr Trump is polling a bit better with blacks and Hispanics than he did last time round.</p></blockquote><p >This is pretty much what happened in November. But covid-19 was making forecasting the election difficult. At the end of May we ran a cover with the headline “The American way” as the country passed 100,000 deaths from the virus. We <a href="https://www.economist.com/leaders/2020/05/28/how-the-worlds-most-powerful-country-is-handling-covid-19">argued</a>, on the basis of deaths per person, that America was not in fact doing any worse than Europe. But this was despite rather than because of the Trump administration’s approach to the virus, which consisted of little more than attempting to contain it through positive thinking (“It’s going to go away, hopefully at the end of the month. And, if not, hopefully it will be soon after that,” was the president’s take in March).</p><p >Incumbent presidents usually get re-elected, so Mr Trump had that in his favour. On the other hand, his approval rating never went much above 40% and the economy was being battered by the virus. We were testing our election forecast <a href="https://www.economist.comhttps://projects.economist.com/us-2020-forecast/president">model</a>, which we would make public in early June. The model, the first to be published by a newspaper disguised as a magazine (or, in fact by any reputable publication or website) gave Mr Trump a one-in-five chance of winning. That probability held fairly steady until October, when it decreased.</p><p >What could improve Mr Trump’s odds? The rapid development of a vaccine would help, and we were <a href="https://www.economist.com/united-states/2020/07/18/donald-trump-is-hoping-for-a-covid-19-treatment-by-november">complimentary</a> about the administration’s plan to bring this about, Operation Warp Speed. What else? Perhaps Mr Trump could somehow recast the election as being about something other than the soaring unemployment rate and the virus’s death toll. That something came along after an unarmed African-American man, George Floyd, was killed by a Minneapolis policeman in late May.</p><p >The reaction to Floyd’s death was astonishing. Of course the actions of the police officers involved showed a shocking casual cruelty. But that was also true in 2014, when a New York police officer choked Eric Garner to death for allegedly selling untaxed cigarettes on Staten Island, one of several such killings that gave prominence to the Black Lives Matter movement during Barack Obama’s second term. This time the reaction was different: Floyd’s killing inspired what were probably <a href="https://www.economist.com/united-states/2020/05/31/protests-sparked-by-george-floyds-death-are-still-raging">the biggest civil-rights demonstrations in American history</a>. ACLED, an organisation which counted them, reckoned there were more than 10,000 demonstrations, spread all across the country.</p><p >Cooped-up by covid-19 and infuriated by Mr Trump, urban America took to the streets. These protests were largely peaceful, but there was enough looting and disorder to present Mr Trump with an opening. The <a href="https://www.economist.com/united-states/2020/06/01/history-is-repeated-in-protests-at-the-death-of-george-floyd">parallels with 1968</a>, when Richard Nixon ran a successful law-and-order campaign against Hubert Humphrey, seemed uncanny. That year a new strain of flu killed 100,000 Americans and also saw widespread demonstrations and unrest in American cities after the assassination of Martin Luther King. Nixon’s law-and-order campaign promised to deliver order to the silent majority, who both feared and disapproved of the hippies, anti-war activists and civil-rights types who seemed to be taking over the culture. Mr Trump took to tweeting “Law and Order” in all caps. Some activists talked of defunding the police. Mr Trump tried to tie Mr Biden to them. The Trump campaign put out a creepy advert featuring an elderly white lady fumbling for the telephone as some unknown assailant tried to batter down her door.</p><p >Yet, just as with the death toll and economic damage wrought by the virus, the protests and the riots did not move presidential polling. Mr Trump’s approval numbers stayed pretty much where they had been at the beginning of his presidency. Mr Biden’s lead in head-to-head polling remained steady. Each time a big event happened—California’s particularly bad wildfires in August, the death of <a href="https://www.economist.com/obituary/2020/09/23/ruth-bader-ginsburg-died-on-september-18th">Ruth Bader Ginsburg</a> in September and the fight over her successor—pundits wondered whether this would be the thing that tilted the election decisively, changing the polling in one direction or another. Each time the answer was no. <a href="https://www.economist.com/united-states/2020/10/10/the-battle-in-miniature">Partisanship</a> ran so deep that nothing seemed capable of changing views on the president or his opponent.</p><p >As the election drew closer, our model gave Mr Biden a 90% chance of victory. This alarmed editors scarred by the failure of polls to foresee Mr Trump’s victory in 2016. In October our shoe-leather reporting pointed out that Mr Trump was doing better than might have been expected with Hispanic voters in <a href="https://www.economist.com/united-states/2020/10/03/why-donald-trump-is-doing-surprisingly-well-in-florida">Florida</a> and also in <a href="https://www.economist.com/united-states/2020/10/27/latino-men-are-a-bright-spot-in-donald-trumps-faltering-campaign">Texas</a>. When the election results eventually came in, after a week in which our correspondents ran on coffee and adrenaline, Mr Trump’s relatively good numbers with Hispanics would be one of the stories of the election. Another would be the deepening of America’s <a href="https://www.economist.com/united-states/2020/11/14/our-analysis-of-the-election-results-suggests-that-2020-accelerated-a-long-running-trend">urban-rural divide</a>.</p><p >That should have been the end of the contest, but because the president is Mr Trump it was not. That he disputed the results was not a surprise: we had <a href="https://www.economist.com/leaders/2020/09/03/americas-ugly-election">predicted</a> that he would. Yet what could not be known in advance was how many elected Republicans would go along with his attempt to overturn the result.</p><p >The answer was almost all of them. Hardly any said that what Mr Trump did was wrong. This was mostly an act of political self-preservation: why take a stance against the head of the party when he would soon be gone? The trouble was this implicated most elected Republicans in the bizarre arguments made by the president’s team that one-way errors made by voting machines had somehow snatched the election from Mr Trump (even though Mr Biden won the popular vote by more than 7m), and sent a strong signal to ordinary Republican voters that Mr Biden was not the legitimate winner (a position that <a href="https://www.economist.comhttps://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2020/11/19/only-a-quarter-of-republicans-believe-donald-trump-should-concede">more than 80%</a> of Republican voters held weeks after the election).</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-3"></div></div></div><p >Even in defeat, then, Mr Trump forced us again to consider questions that had not gone away since his inauguration. How much damage was he doing to American democracy? How strong was his hold over the Republican Party? When 106 Republican members of Congress backed the 17 Republican attorneys-general who brought a frivolous lawsuit attempting to overturn the election result, the answer to these questions was not reassuring. No review of 2020 is complete without one quote from the president’s Twitter feed (sorry). On December 22nd, almost two months after he lost the election, he wrote: “THE DEMOCRATS DUMPED HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF BALLOTS IN THE SWING STATES LATE IN THE EVENING. IT WAS A RIGGED ELECTION!!!”</p><p >Politics and covid-19 understandably dominated our coverage of America in 2020, but looking back there were also lots of interesting stories that had nothing to do with Mr Trump or the virus. We were early to highlight the risks associated with trans children taking <a href="https://www.economist.com/united-states/2020/01/30/a-new-push-to-ban-medical-treatments-for-transgender-children">puberty blockers</a>, and were writing about <a href="https://www.economist.com/united-states/2020/02/22/anger-in-a-time-of-autism">vaccine scepticism</a> before it became clear covid-19 vaccines would become so important. We wrote about the phenomenon of military recruits increasingly coming <a href="https://www.economist.com/united-states/2020/04/18/recruits-to-americas-armed-forces-are-not-what-they-used-to-be">from well-off families</a> and about an extensive but little-known programme called <a href="https://www.economist.com/united-states/2020/05/07/asap-is-more-important-than-affirmative-action">ASAP</a> that does a lot for social mobility in America. If politics recedes from the news a bit in 2021 that will create more space for stories about how the country is changing in ways that have little to do with the conflict between Democrats and Republican.</p><p >What could we have done better? Plenty. But, looking back, the gentle scepticism, avoidance of cynicism and reluctance to pretend to greater certainty than our reporting justified, seems like a good approach to making sense of a strange year. </p>
