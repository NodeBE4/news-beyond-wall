But while their covid-related problems are easing, pubs and restaurants face a new difficulty: a staff shortage.</p><p >The shortage is most acute in London and the south-east. For Mortadella, a chain of three south London restaurants, one of which has just opened, it is “a bit of a scramble”, according to Sam Andrews, the group’s executive head chef. “All three places will be understaffed.”</p><p >Lorenzo Manconi, chief executive of Romet Group, a chain of nine restaurants and pubs in London and Essex, says Brexit is part of the problem. Many of the European workers whom he put on furlough during the pandemic are now heading home. He has replaced them with Britons, and 70% of his staff have no experience. “They will need training and it will cost us extra and we aren’t sure if they are going to stay with us long term,” he says. Job postings for pub and restaurant positions on Indeed, a recruitment website, were up by 82% in the four weeks to May 7th, and are now 4% above their pre-pandemic level.</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p >Firms complaining of a problem finding workers is hard to square with the official labour-market data. According to the Office for National Statistics (<small>ONS</small>), the unemployment rate was 4.9% in February, up by around a percentage point on a year before, and that number may be an underestimate, as the pandemic has made collecting the data harder. Other measures of the jobs market tracked by the <small>ONS</small> point to a sharper spike in joblessness. As the economy reopens analysts are keeping a close eye out for bottlenecks that could push prices higher. But the hospitality sector is not typical of the wider economy.</p><p >Along with bricks-and-mortar retailing, the hospitality industry was the sector worst-hit by the pandemic. It suffered from being the first to be closed and the last to reopen. Bosses believe many of their own furloughed workers have been tempted away from hospitality to sectors such as retail or logistics which have already reopened, while the scheme as a whole is diminishing incentives for workers in declining industries to look for a new role. Many of the European migrants on whom the hospitality industry has relied have gone home, and students, who would usually work a few shifts a week, are now in the wrong parts of the country. Demand for staff has been boosted by the social-distancing rule that pubs must serve customers at tables.</p><p >Wage rates do not yet seem to be responding to the shortage of staff. According to Indeed, the median advertised salary in the sector was £9.25 an hour from January until April and has ticked up to just £9.38 an hour in May even as the volume of complaints from bosses has risen. Some larger firms are considering raising pay but enforced closures have drained the reserves of many of their smaller peers. “There just isn’t any more money in the bank,” says Mr Andrews, who says his firm is using staff food, discounts and treats to attract employees. “When the industry reopens fully, it is going to have to re-evaluate what it pays.”</p><p >With Britons eager to socialise and bookings for pub and restaurant tables hard to come by, prices are likely to rise. If some of the cash from all that pent-up demand finds its way into wage packets, the staff shortage should ease. <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p><p ><strong>Dig deeper</strong></p><p ><em>All our stories relating to the pandemic and the vaccines can be found on our <a href="https://www.economist.com/news/2020/03/11/the-economists-coverage-of-the-coronavirus">coronavirus hub</a>.
