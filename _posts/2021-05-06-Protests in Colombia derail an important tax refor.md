They have burned buses and police stations and looted banks and shops. Protesters also blocked all the main roads leading to Cali, the country’s third-largest city, for several days, resulting in empty shelves in grocery shops and a shortage of medicine in hospitals. At least 24 people died and more than 800 civilians and police officers have been injured. On May 1st Iván Duque, the president, sent in the army to quell the violence.</p><p >The protests were triggered by a tax-reform bill the government sent to Congress on April 15th. On May 2nd Mr Duque withdrew the unpopular bill. The next day the finance minister, Alberto Carrasquilla, resigned. But resentment against the president, whose approval rating is 33%, means that the unrest is likely to continue.</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p >Mr Duque’s reform was sorely needed. Because of the pandemic, Colombia’s deficit has tripled to nearly 8% of <small>GDP</small>. The reform would have <a href="https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2020/10/15/colombia-tries-to-fix-a-messy-and-unfair-tax">removed many <small>VAT</small> exemptions</a> and lowered the threshold for starting to pay income tax. (Income-tax revenues in Colombia are among the lowest as a share of <small>GDP</small> in the <small>OECD</small>, a club mostly of rich countries.) Pensions would have been taxed, too. Spending on social programmes would have increased, potentially benefiting 19m people. Mr Carrasquilla claims the bill could have reduced the share of Colombians who are extremely poor (earning less than 145,000 pesos a month, or $38) by six percentage points.</p><p >Most Colombians, however, saw it as unfair. One of the longest lockdowns in the world has emptied wallets and sapped morale. Last year 2.8m people fell into extreme poverty. More than 500,000 businesses have closed. Even though the tax increases would hit the wealthiest hardest, 80% of people, when surveyed, opposed the bill.</p><p >The bill was not the protesters’ only grievance. Colombians are frustrated, particularly with Mr Duque. The president promised to make the country safer. But violence is getting worse. Colombia is exporting record amounts of cocaine and illegal armed groups are growing stronger. Since 2016, the year a peace deal was signed with the <small>FARC</small>, the country’s biggest rebel army, other armed groups have driven a growing number of rural people from their homes and murdered hundreds of local leaders. Colombians also blame the government for mishandling the pandemic.</p><p >Indeed after Mr Duque withdrew the reform, the protests became far more violent. The government has been chided for its excessive use of force. An armoured vehicle was filmed in Bogotá firing live ammunition in a residential neighbourhood. The ombudsman is investigating the disappearance of around 40 people.</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p >On May 4th Mr Duque said he would set up a “forum for national dialogue”, where the government will meet protesters and other civil groups. As <em>The Economist</em> went to press, it seemed that some of the protesters would meet with the government on May 10th. But as their list of demands has grown longer—to include withdrawing a health-reform bill, introducing a guaranteed minimum income and an end to the forced eradication of coca crops, among other grievances—so too has the likelihood that they will not leave the streets.</p><p >All this will make Mr Duque weaker. Unlike his predecessors, he does not have a stable majority coalition in Congress. Even his mentor, Álvaro Uribe, a former president, has distanced himself from Mr Duque; he was one of the first to speak out against the bill.</p><p >Gustavo Petro, a left-winger, is gaining momentum in the polls. He lost against Mr Duque in the presidential elections of 2018, but is planning to run again next year. He has proposed that the central bank print more money to deal with the aftermath of the pandemic, and has praised the late Hugo Chávez, the despotic socialist who set Venezuela on the path to ruin. Instead of a bold tax reform, Mr Duque’s legacy may instead turn out to be ensuring that Colombia gets its first socialist president. <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p><p ><em>A version of this article was published online on May 3rd, 2021</em></p><p data-test-id="Footnote" >This article appeared in the The Americas section of the print edition under the headline &quot;Taxing times&quot;</p>
