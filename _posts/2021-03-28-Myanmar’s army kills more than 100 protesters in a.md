The day is a national holiday, dedicated to the glories of the army, celebrated with columns of goose-stepping soldiers, fluttering flags and displays of weaponry. But no amount of fanfare could distract from the hollowness of the commander’s words. Across Myanmar, security forces were, at his direction, attempting to crush a persistent protest movement opposed to <a href="https://www.economist.com/briefing/2021/02/06/myanmars-coup-turns-the-clock-back-a-decade">the coup the army initiated</a> on February 1st. This year’s Armed Forces Day will be remembered not for the marches and speeches, but for the army’s conduct off the parade ground. The self-proclaimed guardians of the people went on the rampage, killing at least 114 of their charges in the deadliest day since the coup thus far.</p><p >The people had been warned. On the previous day the regime, via its military-run television channel, had threatened to shoot protesters “in the back and the back of the head” if they continued to defy it. Read in an eerily calm voice by a newsreader over the sound of gentle piano music, the army’s threat was a tacit admission that its forces were not dispersing protesters with “minimum force”, as it had insisted for weeks. Until March 27th roughly a quarter of those killed by security forces had been shot in the head, according to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners, a local monitoring group.</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p >Though a small number of protesters have armed themselves with home-made weapons, such as slingshots and air guns, most demonstrations are peaceful. Some victims of the crackdown are not even protesters. A growing number of bystanders, including children, are getting caught up in the violence. On Armed Forces Day alone a one-year-old was hit in the eye with a rubber bullet, a 13-year-old girl was shot dead in her home and a 16-year-old boy on a motorbike was gunned down by security forces in an unmarked car. The bloodshed, which involved killings in cities and towns across the country, brings the number of protesters and bystanders killed since the coup began to more than 440.</p><p >Censure was swift. America, Britain and the European Union, which have placed sanctions on the commander and his associates, condemned the violence. Defence chiefs from 12 Asian, European and North American countries urged the army, or Tatmadaw, as it is known, to desist. But the condemnation was not universal. Representatives of China, India and Russia attended the official festivities. General Min Aung Hlaing called Russia, which sent its defence minister, a “true friend”. Russia and China have used their votes on the UN Security Council to shield the Tatmadaw from being referred to the International Criminal Court, which investigates and prosecutes war crimes.</p><p >The Burmese people’s opposition to the coup is unwavering. Spilling yet more blood is unlikely to break their spirit. One 24-year-old protester has spent the last several weeks defending barricades in his neighbourhood in Yangon, the commercial capital, armed with nothing more than Molotov cocktails and slingshots. His group of frontline protesters is outmanned and outgunned; yet he thinks that his opponents “are more scared than we are”. The Committee Representing Pyidaungsu Hluttaw, a group of MPs trying to set up a rival, civilian government, has discussed uniting several militias representing ethnic minorities into a “federal” army to resist the Tatmadaw. Some students, activists and office workers have fled to jungles on Myanmar’s borders, beyond the control of the Tatmadaw, where they are receiving military training and drawing up plans to sabotage military facilities, according to the <em>New York Times</em>.</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p >The chances of a ragtag group of civilians defeating an army whose mettle has been tempered through decades of combat are ludicrously low. But a concerted rebellion by the numerous ethnic militias that have occupied Myanmar’s restive borderlands would certainly make life difficult for the Tatmadaw. It engineered a ceasefire with one such militia, the Arakan Army, two months before the coup, so that it could redirect troops to the centre of the country, where it anticipated protests in opposition to its coup, writes Anthony Davis, a security analyst. If it has to fight on multiple fronts, it will find it harder to bring the country to heel.</p><p >Some militias have already raised the stakes. The Kachin Independence Army, which had largely refrained from clashing with the Tatmadaw since it began negotiating a ceasefire in 2018, has skirmished with government troops several times since the coup. It overran an army position in Kachin state on March 15th. The Karen National Union, a party to the army’s ceasefire agreement with several insurgent groups, has allied with protesters and claimed to have seized an army base in Kayin state on March 27th. On the same day Yawd Serk, leader of the Shan State Army, one of the biggest militias and another signatory of the ceasefire, told Reuters that he supports the formation of a federal army. “The ethnic armed groups now have a similar enemy and we need to join hands and hurt those that are hurting the people,” he said. The bloodshed on Armed Forces Day, unfortunately, will not be the end of the violence.</p>
