We’d been there on holiday a few times. My sons were learning Spanish at school.</p><p >Maybe it was because our lives had been reduced to the same one-kilometre radius of Paris. Maybe we needed the promise of some future excitement in a warmer climate to get us through the coming grey and rainy months. Or maybe there just seemed to be an exotic magic about the word “tapas”. But within a few minutes of starting to discuss how much we all liked Spain, we’d collectively hatched a plan. We’d pack up our home and move to Madrid for the next school year.</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p >At the time this seemed like a freak, spontaneous decision. Only later did I realise that people all around me were launching life-changing projects of their own, or having epiphanies about who they were and what really mattered. In the early days of the pandemic, it had seemed like an achievement just not to get ill. But at this latter stage we (the worried well, at least) needed proof that, though we were stuck at home, our lives were advancing.</p><p >But were they? Some people have had genuine psychological or career breakthroughs over lockdown. One woman I know has finally given up on dating tiny, narcissistic men and shacked up with a seemingly healthy giant. Another has put aside her career writing history books about the war and now performs uplifting music on her ukulele, via Zoom. (“I don’t have to drag myself and others down to deep hard questions,” she said. “I can just bring light!”)</p><p >For every person who has earnestly reassessed her life, there’s someone else who realises she’s been deprioritised. A mother in Seattle told me that when families in her neighbourhood created socialising and home-school bubbles at the start of the pandemic, she and her children weren’t included. “It’s a little painful when you don’t quite make the cut,” she said.</p><p >Others have simply lowered their standards for what constitutes a major life change. I know people for whom not gaining weight is a triumph. Some men have taken excessive pride in their pandemic hair growth.</p><p >Then there are those who’ve finally faced up to who they truly are – to the detriment of everyone else. My husband’s great covid-era insight was that other people “were all too much”. Finally freed of the obligation to attend lunches and dinner parties, he has finished two books and embarked on a third, thus morphing into his authentic self: a workaholic.</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p >His extreme productivity seems to be the exception. More common are those who’ve developed a new passion for non-work activities like running, yoga or pet care. My social-media feed is filled with friends who’d never mentioned plants before, but now post worshipful photos of spring buds. One publishes a daily poem about her peonies.</p><p data-caps="initial" ><span data-caps="initial">I </span>took up tennis last year, as a way to detach myself from my computer and spend time outdoors. Soon I was playing at least four times a week. I delighted in my first-ever attempt at work-life balance, until my husband pointed out that I’d become less of a writer who dabbles in sport, and more like a bourgeois lady who’s obsessed with her backhand. I’d merely replaced overwork with excessive tennis.</p><p >For many of us, these new escapist plans and pleasures mask darker truths. One friend gushed to me about his puppy, then confessed that lockdown has come to feel like a “sensory deprivation chamber”. An outwardly happy 50-something who Zooms from home all day admitted that she has started pining for retirement. Another, who has barely touched another human for over a year, said she’d like to emerge transformed by the pandemic but for the moment she just feels numb.</p><p >It’s different for our kids. One advantage of being a teenager during the crisis is that – as long as you’ve kept up with schoolwork and don’t seem completely morose – there’s little pressure to treat the global health emergency as a kind of self-help retreat. “No, we’re not 50, we don’t do that,” my 15-year-old daughter snapped.</p><p >Yet even she has been inspired to make a big change. Somehow that dinner-table decision to move to Spain is turning into reality. We’ve now rented out our flat in Paris and enrolled the kids in a Spanish school for September. My husband will no doubt buckle down and overwork there too, while I play too much tennis. But at least we&#x27;ll do it with tapas. I can work on improving my soul at a later date.<span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p><p ><strong>Pamela Druckerman</strong> is a columnist for <em>1843</em> and author of the children’s picture book “Paris By Phone”</p><p >ILLUSTRATIONS: <strong>MANSHEN LO</strong></p><p >PULL QUOTES</p><p >I’d merely replaced overwork with excessive tennis </p><p >All around me people were launching life-changing projects of their own</p><p >TWEETS</p><p >Will covid mean the end of all our adventuring?
