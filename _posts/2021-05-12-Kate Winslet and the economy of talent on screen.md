Or eating. In “Mare of Easttown”, a crime drama set in small-town Pennsylvania currently airing on HBO and Sky Atlantic, Kate Winslet gives a masterclass in how to eat in character. Playing Mare Sheehan, a bereaved, divorced detective, she stretches her mouth to cram in a cheesesteak hoagie. She swills beer like a pro. The give-a-shit table manners speak volumes about Mare, every munch conveying a harried world-weariness. From a different angle, her performance is instructive about the economy of talent on screen.</p><p >In the first episode, with grim predictability, a young woman’s almost-naked corpse is found in a creek. But the show is less interested in the crime than in the community that is its context—adults all-too aware that life can be tragic, and teenagers who know more than the adults realise. The intimacy and companionship, snooping and claustrophobia, are conveyed by a top-notch ensemble of actors, including Guy Pearce. (His character picks up Mare in a bar, but he is too famous to be merely a romantic distraction: keep an eye on him.)</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p >Even in this distinguished company, Ms Winslet’s gestures and expressions stand out. Lips curled, pursed and bitten, ground and grimacing teeth, eyes rolled and averted, the occasional, fleeting, hard-won smile—all are entirely naturalistic yet perfectly calibrated for the camera. When an interloping cop tries to be conciliatory to Mare, a grudging, stifled flick of the wrist embodies, in a flash, the vulnerability beneath her bravado.</p><p >It is startling how startling this performance seems. Acting, after all, is one of the world’s most competitive professions. Many people can recall a school-play star who never even made it to drama school. Most who do end up waiting tables while they flunk auditions before calling it a day. Of the millions of wannabees, only a handful scramble to the top; anyone in a leading role in a prime-time drama has triumphed. And yet the gulf between Ms Winslet’s craft and run-of-the-mill TV leads is glaring. (This gap between the best, and the merely exceptional, is similarly stark in football: Lionel Messi’s twists and feints make his world-class teammates at Barcelona look pedestrian.)</p><p >Ms Winslet’s turn on the box has two lessons. First, it reflects the evolution of entertainment in the era of streaming—and in the age of covid. Marquee names have been moving from big screen to box-sets since Martin Sheen and Kevin Spacey turned up in “The West Wing” and “House of Cards”. The migration has continued as cable channels and, especially, ambitious streaming services such as Netflix have sprayed money at drama, meaning better scripts and subtler parts as well as higher fees. Think of Reese Witherspoon, Nicole Kidman and even Meryl Streep in “Big Little Lies”, or Ms Kidman’s recent <em>pas de deux</em> with Hugh Grant in “The Undoing”. To viewers of a certain age, A-listers still seem out of place on the telly, like running into your boss in a changing room. But the trend is unlikely to be reversed. By closing cinemas and diverting movies to TV, the pandemic has accelerated it.</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p >The other lesson concerns justice. That might seem in short supply in Easttown; but even if Ms Winslet’s put-upon detective struggles to achieve it in the story, she embodies it in another way.</p><p >Stardom is often thought to be a matter of good fortune more than desert, a result of serendipitous meetings and lucky breaks. In an influential economics paper published 40 years ago, for instance, Sherwin Rosen asked why, seemingly irrationally, top-billing musicians, comedians and others earned vastly more than those ranked slightly below them. His answer involved the reach of reputations, the multiplying effect of shared preferences and the scale of the market. In “Thinking Fast and Slow”, Daniel Kahneman offers a pair of hard-boiled equations: “Success = talent + luck” and “Great success = a little more talent + a lot of luck.” Often celebrity does indeed seem an artefact of hype rather than merit. As in Easttown, life is often unfair. And then you die.</p><p >Just occasionally, though, the hype is justified. “Mare of Easttown” showcases a justly renowned performer doing a hard thing thrillingly well. The plot may be depressing, but the effect is oddly consoling. Sometimes, the show suggests, people really do get what they deserve.</p><p ><em>“Mare of Easttown” is available to watch on HBO in America and Sky Atlantic in Britain now</em></p>
