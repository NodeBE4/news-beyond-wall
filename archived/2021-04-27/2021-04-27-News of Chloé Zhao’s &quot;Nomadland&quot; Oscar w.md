State media proclaimed she was the pride of China. Ms Zhao became the most viewed topic on Weibo, a microblog, where Chinese celebrities rushed to post messages. “Congratulations,” gushed Zhang Ziyi, star of “Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon”, “Look forward to the Oscars.” Two months on, however, as Ms Zhao became the first woman of colour to win an Oscar for best director, and “Nomadland” also scooped the award for Best Picture, censors in China scrubbed any mention of the wins from social media and the internet.</p><p >What happened? The answer is a nationalist backlash that has become all too common in today’s China. A few days after Ms Zhao won the Golden Globe, internet users dug up comments she had made in 2013, when she criticised China as “a place where there are lies everywhere”. Ms Zhao, who moved to Britain when she was 14 for school and later attended college in America, was then quoted by an Australian news site in December 2020 as saying America “is now my country, ultimately”. This was wrong: the news site has now said it had misquoted her, and that what she had said was “America is not my country”. After the uproar, censors pounced, removing content about “Nomadland” from the Chinese internet even before the Oscars ceremony.</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p >Nationalist trolls have long been intolerant of speech deemed critical of China on the Chinese internet. But the government, afraid of looking weak to its citizens, is now endorsing these attacks. It has intervened to cancel the distribution of “Nomadland” in China (the film was due to be released on April 23rd but there has yet to be a screening). Ms Zhao is not the first to be dealt with in this way. In June last year, Hao Haidong, a Chinese footballer who is the country’s top scorer in international matches and now lives abroad, said that “the Communist Party’s totalitarian rule in China has caused horrific atrocities against humanity.” He soon lost his account on Weibo, and Chinese websites deleted all mention of him and his wife, a former world-champion badminton player.</p><p >In 2020, Fang Fang, a writer from Wuhan who kept a quarantine diary throughout the city’s lockdown, was read by tens of millions across the country and heralded as “the conscience of Wuhan”. But once it was announced that an American publisher was translating her diary into English, she was labelled as unpatriotic and faced an online onslaught of nationalist vituperation. Her books have been shunned by Chinese publishers, and Chinese media outlets have been ordered to stop publishing her work. “This is the trolls winning,” says Michael Berry of UCLA, who translated Ms Fang’s work. “They are becoming so powerful that these attacks can escalate to the point they result in actual political decisions being made based often on conspiracy theories, lies and rumours the trolls put on social media.”</p><p >The danger for the government is that this kneejerk censorship does not make China look strong, as it desires, but weak. One documentary filmmaker in China said he had been made “speechless by China’s cowardice and cover-up”.</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p >China also has a broader agenda: to promote homegrown movies and weaken American cultural dominance. The era of China seeking validation from Hollywood may be over, says Ying Zhu, a professor of media culture at the City University of New York. And an increasingly rocky relationship with America is causing the Communist Party to be less obsessed with prestigious international awards such as the Nobel Prize or the Academy Awards. Nine out of its ten top-grossing films this year were Chinese. A recent newspaper editorial suggested that China should build its own Hollywood and have its own awards ceremony. The Oscars, it argues, are “still dictated by Western tastes and standards”.</p><p >Something like that may already be under way. The leading Chinese-language film festival has traditionally been the Golden Horse Awards, founded in 1962 and held annually in Taiwan. In 2018, the winner of the Best Documentary category called in her acceptance speech for Taiwan’s independence. Ever since, China has banned all mainland filmmakers from attending. It also scheduled its own version, the Golden Rooster awards, to take place on the same night in 2019 as the Golden Horse, in the city of Xiamen, just across the Taiwan Strait, forcing filmmakers from across the Chinese-speaking world to choose which festival to attend. Many, unable to resist its huge market, picked China. “China effectively took what was the most vibrant pan-Chinese film festival and turned it into a local Taiwanese film festival,” says Mr Berry.</p><p >Since 2014 Xi Jinping, China’s president, has stressed the importance of “cultural confidence”, saying that the mission of artists and filmmakers is to nurture “the root and soul of the nation”. As the relationship between America and China has worsened, bicultural, bilingual artists such as Ms Zhao could be providing an important bridge with the world. In her acceptance speech, she portrayed China in a positive light, speaking warmly about memorising Chinese poetry with her father as a child and switching into Mandarin to quote a famous line from classical Chinese. Some in China think the party’s treatment of Ms Zhao is a missed opportunity for the country to promote its soft power.</p><p >The authorities have a long history of censoring leading Chinese filmmakers. The prestigious “Fifth Generation” of filmmakers, which included Zhang Yimou and Chen Kaige, had to battle the censors at home, even as they won awards abroad. Their tussles continue to this day. Mr Zhang’s latest film, “One Second” was supposed to have its première at the Berlin Film Festival in 2019 but had to be withdrawn days before for “technical reasons”.</p><p >Documentaries have also come under attack. “Do Not Split”, a film about pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong in 2019, was nominated for an Academy Award for best short documentary, but Chinese state media dismissed it as a “fake”. Mainland China has shied away from broadcasting the Oscars ever since Richard Gere used the ceremony in 1993 to protest against the Chinese government’s rule over Tibet.</p><p >In the end, as with all good movies, there may be room for redemption. Since the Oscars, Global Times, a nationalistic newspaper, has published an English-language commentary praising Ms Zhao for her warmness towards her Chinese roots and suggesting she could have a “mediating role” in future. Others have been rehabilitated. Mr Zhang, despite his continuing battles with the censors, was brought back into the fold to help direct the opening ceremony of the 2008 Olympics in Beijing. But making peace with the authorities often carries a cost in terms of artistic freedom.</p><p >Ms Zhao’s next film as director is “Eternals”, a superhero movie from the Marvel franchise, which is expected to be released in America in November. Marvel will be hoping the film also does well in China, which has overtaken America to become the largest box-office market in the world. That Ms Zhao is Chinese may have been part of her attraction to the producers who hired her. But that is now looking more like a liability.</p>
