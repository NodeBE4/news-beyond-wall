Not all presidents are in the money. Andrew Jackson, who these days looks out quizzically from the back of every $10 bill, was born poor, married a rich heiress who smoked a corncob pipe, and died with 150 slaves, a 1,000-acre plantation and wealth equivalent to $133m.</p><p >Thomas Jefferson, the face on the $2 note, inherited 3,000 acres in his teens but died in debt, his slaves mortgaged, after failing to dispose of his stuff by public lottery. For Jefferson there was a final consolation. He died on July 4th 1826. The same July 4th on which his predecessor, John Adams, breathed his last – yet Adams died in credit, with a 40-acre estate to his name, and no human property on the ledger.</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p >Accountancy has a moral dimension. It shows what we acquire or fail to acquire, and what we’re prepared to reveal about that process. That’s why, since Richard Nixon had a little trouble with the Internal Revenue Service (<small>IRS</small>) in the early 1970s, American presidents have been expected to share their tax returns. (If Watergate hadn’t happened, we would remember this better.)</p><p >The focus is usually on financial conduct before and during office – scrutiny of the early investment history of the Clintons, for example, became one of the most popular journalistic subgenres of the 1990s. Those post-presidential years, though, tell an equally compelling story. They reveal something about the shifting value of the office as well as the values of its holders.</p><p >The spoils of slavery account for the prosperous last years of many pre-abolition presidents. But not all. The wealth of George Washington, who often tops historical White House rich lists, was more the product of his uniquely vast $25,000 salary. ($728,000 in today’s money and 2% of the total American budget in 1789.)</p><p >Presidential pay is no longer as generous. At the moment it’s $400,000 a year. But since 1958 it has come with a pension for which all living presidents are eligible – this is linked to the pay of senior government officials, and is currently set at $219,200. The measure helped save the dignity of Harry S. Truman, whose main source of income before the Former Presidents Act took effect was the $112.56 a month he received in recognition for his military service.</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p >Soon Donald Trump will join Jimmy Carter, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama on this exclusive list of pensioners. His first cheque arrives in January. Unless, of course, it were to go straight to his creditors.</p><figure><div itemscope="" itemProp="image" itemType="https://schema.org/ImageObject" data-slim=""><meta itemProp="url" content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/1329/90/1843magazine.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/PostPresidency01x1280.jpg"/><img loading="lazy" width="1280" height="1329" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/1329/90/1843magazine.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/PostPresidency01x1280.jpg"  sizes="(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw" alt=""/></div></figure><p ><strong>The congressman</strong> John Quincy Adams <em>1825-29</em><br/> Today the circadian rhythm of a presidential afterlife involves memoir, self-memorialisation, charitable work and speaking engagements charged at new-swimming-pool prices. In the 1830s those conventions had yet to be established, though that didn’t stop people pondering why John Quincy Adams would want to follow one term in the White House with nine terms in Congress. (Among those who wondered was his wife, Louisa.)</p><p >It had not been his intention. During the election campaign of 1828 Adams had been wounded by accusations of corruption and embezzlement. His presidency, he reflected, comprised “the four most miserable years of my life”. Once they were over, the inherited wealth of his father, President John Adams, protected him from poverty. So why did he make his comeback?</p><p >A month after leaving office, his eldest son, George Washington Adams, drowned himself in the Long Island Sound. (He had fallen into alcoholism and depression, and impregnated the chambermaid of the Adams family-doctor.) The bereaved father vowed to “employ the remaining days which Thou hast allotted me on Earth to purposes…tributary to the well-being of others”.</p><p >From this impulse flowed many acts of political virtue, including the repeal of the gag rule that prevented Congress hearing petitions relating to slavery, and a Supreme Court victory in the <em>Amistad</em> case, when he defended slaves who mutinied aboard a Spanish ship. Achievements that made his presidency look like an interlude.</p><figure><div itemscope="" itemProp="image" itemType="https://schema.org/ImageObject" data-slim=""><meta itemProp="url" content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/1139/90/1843magazine.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/PostPresidency02x1280.jpg"/><img loading="lazy" width="1280" height="1139" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/1139/90/1843magazine.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/PostPresidency02x1280.jpg"  sizes="(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw" alt=""/></div></figure><p ><strong>The autobiographer</strong> Ulysses Grant <em>1869-77</em><br/> Italian swindler Charles Ponzi was only two years old in 1884, far too young to have given his name to the kind of scheme in which Ulysses Grant, former president and civil-war action man, agreed to sink $150,000 dollars that he didn’t really have.</p><p >Ferdinand Ward, known as “the Young Napoleon of Finance”, and the business partner of Grant’s son, was the man who persuaded Grant to sign on the dotted line – and whose fall obliged Grant to face his Waterloo, until Mark Twain rode in like the cavalry.</p><p >Twain’s plan to refinance Grant was one familiar to embarrassed celebrities from Christine Keeler to the Duchess of Argyll: the sale of his memoirs. The deal was almost incomprehensibly sweet. He got $1,000 on signing and 70% of royalties, as well as living expenses while he hunkered over his desk. But the book came with a horribly literal deadline. Grant raced throat cancer to the final paragraph and was forced to dictate the last of his 336,000 words, swaddled in blankets, wracked with pain, his voice dwindling to silence.</p><p >Twain employed 10,000 men, mostly civil-war veterans, to sell the book door-to-door. The policy worked. The initial 350,000 copies sold quickly. Twain delivered the first royalty fee of $200,000 in person, the largest cheque of this kind ever issued. A further $250,000 was paid out, dwarfing the original debt.</p><p >Grant, sadly, was not sufficiently alive to see his balance go black. Inspired by his success, however, his widow Julia wrote her own book and tried to sell it for $125,000. Nobody bit. It wasn’t published until 1975.</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-3"></div></div></div><figure><div itemscope="" itemProp="image" itemType="https://schema.org/ImageObject" data-slim=""><meta itemProp="url" content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/956/90/1843magazine.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/PostPresidency03x1280.jpg"/><img loading="lazy" width="1280" height="956" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/956/90/1843magazine.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/PostPresidency03x1280.jpg"  sizes="(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw" alt=""/></div></figure><p ><strong>The hunter</strong> Theodore Roosevelt <em>1901-09</em><br/> When Theodore Roosevelt left the White House in 1909 he went out to kill for his country. He took his teenage son, Kermit, his Winchester rifles and his ammo to sub-Saharan Africa, and let the lead fly. The president observed the dress code: at home he liked to hunt in a buckskin two-piece with Dolly Parton fringing; in the Belgian Congo, he went for a pith helmet and massive khaki safari trousers.</p><p >Between them the Roosevelt party felled 512 animals including 29 zebra, 17 lions, 11 elephants, nine giraffes, a couple of porcupines, a pair of bongos and a lone aardwolf. (10,885 smaller and less charismatic creatures failed to make the inventory in Roosevelt’s book “African Game Trails”).</p><p >This was slaughter in the name of science. The expedition was sponsored by the Smithsonian, which took eight years to catalogue the specimens brought back. It was also a kind of interregnum. Roosevelt chose not to retire to his 235-acre estate on Long Island, and remained a loud political presence until his death.</p><p >But Sagamore Hill was also a reminder of lost wealth. He bought the estate when he was 22, using some of the $60,00o fortune inherited from his father. A large proportion of the rest was lost in an ill-fated investment in a North Dakota cattle ranch. Half his herd perished in the freezing winter of 1886-87 – deaths recorded in a less triumphal inventory.</p><figure><div itemscope="" itemProp="image" itemType="https://schema.org/ImageObject" data-slim=""><meta itemProp="url" content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/1238/90/1843magazine.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/PostPresidency04x1280.jpg"/><img loading="lazy" width="1280" height="1238" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/1238/90/1843magazine.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/PostPresidency04x1280.jpg"  sizes="(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw" alt=""/></div></figure><p ><strong>The angler</strong> Herbert Hoover <em>1929-33</em><br/> Herbert Hoover had time to fill. Thirty-one years of it. When he left the White House in 1933 he was two decades younger than Joe Biden will be when he takes the oath. Hoover did the customary post-presidential things: founded a library, toured the world, made the occasional ill-judged political intervention. His own party preferred him to keep a low profile – many Americans blamed him for the Great Depression, which arrived like a dark sky in the seventh month of his presidency. He was too wealthy to worry.</p><p >Hoover had been born in modest circumstances, the son of a Quaker blacksmith in Iowa, but by his 40s he had got rich from the international mining business, a feat achieved as much by his understanding of the stockmarket as his knowledge of pyritic smelting. His later years did not see a return to the humanitarian work of his early career, during which he had organised food relief for German-occupied Belgium and civil-war-struck Russia.</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-4"></div></div></div><p >Instead he communed with the fish, tickling trout in freshwater streams, hauling bonefish from salt-water flats and marlin from the Pacific. “All men are equal before fish,” he wrote in “Fishing for Fun and to Wash Your Soul” (1963), a gumbo of sententious quasi-spiritual essays.</p><p >Fish also played a more doubtful role in his moral and economic life. Hoover was a glassy opponent of Keynesianism. (The New Deal, he said, was fascistic.) But in the hungry 1930s, he did commission one big public-works project in Virginia. It was a 164-acre trout farm on the Rapidan river, built with taxpayer dollars and Marine Corps labour on his own private land.</p><figure><div itemscope="" itemProp="image" itemType="https://schema.org/ImageObject" data-slim=""><meta itemProp="url" content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/905/90/1843magazine.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/PostPresidency05x1280.jpg"/><img loading="lazy" width="1280" height="905" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/905/90/1843magazine.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/PostPresidency05x1280.jpg"  sizes="(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw" alt=""/></div></figure><p ><strong>The cow man</strong> Dwight D. Eisenhower <em>1953-61</em><br/> The archive groans with pictures of Dwight Eisenhower gazing appreciatively at the fat flanks of milk-producing ungulates. In 1950 he and his wife Mamie put down $40,000 on a dilapidated, 189-acre farm adjoining the Gettysburg battlefield in Pennsylvania, intending to retire there. A new job at the White House obliged them to change their plans, but the cattle moved in anyway.</p><p >During Eisenhower’s presidency the stars of his Aberdeen Angus herd won grand championships at the Pennsylvania State Farm Show and blue ribbons at the International Live Stock Competition in Chicago, but were always entered incognito, under the names of his neighbours. Sales, though, seem not to have required bovine modesty. The brochure for his first, in April 1958, features the Eisenhower name and an illustration of his prize bull Ankonian 3551, pictured as if emerging from the furore of a civil-war battle.</p><p >The soldier president spent his last decade biting his tongue about the war in Vietnam, the cost of the space programme and the disrespect of unwashed 1960s youth. Sometimes not too hard. On a Vietnam-themed <small>NBC</small> broadcast in 1967, he ended his remarks by grumbling about the “kooks and hippies and all the rest that are talking about surrendering”. He also had to tolerate an unsought place in the local tourist economy. Visitors who came to view the site of the Gettysburg battlefield considered his house part of the trail.</p><figure><div itemscope="" itemProp="image" itemType="https://schema.org/ImageObject" data-slim=""><meta itemProp="url" content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/908/90/1843magazine.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/PostPresidency06x1280.jpg"/><img loading="lazy" width="1280" height="908" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/908/90/1843magazine.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/PostPresidency06x1280.jpg"  sizes="(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw" alt=""/></div></figure><p ><strong>The tax-avoider</strong> Richard Nixon <em>1969-74</em><br/> According to Gerald Ford, America’s long national nightmare ended when his predecessor was helicoptered out of the White House in 1974 with nothing but a full, free and absolute pardon. But a Get Out of Jail Free card doesn’t guarantee a peaceful sleep, particularly if you’ve had your fingers in the Community Chest.</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-5"></div></div></div><p >The unhappy story of Richard Nixon’s bank account established the precedent that a president’s tax return should be above suspicion. The unhappiness began before his resignation. In 1973 an <small>IRS</small> agent leaked documents to the <em>Providence Journal-Bulletin</em> showing that in 1970, Nixon had paid only $792.81 in federal income tax on his $200,000 salary.</p><p >The Joint Committee on Taxation concluded that he owed $475,431, roughly half his net worth – which was already under pressure from the $1m in legal costs accrued by Watergate. Questions were also being asked about the $500,000 tax relief he’d received for donating his personal papers to the nation.</p><p >These costs prevented Nixon from living a life of seclusion and contemplation. The fees he received for his memoirs ($2m), for his itchy and rancorous interview with David Frost ($600,000) and for the sale of his Florida homes (around $1m) were necessary acts to clear his debts.</p><figure><div itemscope="" itemProp="image" itemType="https://schema.org/ImageObject" data-slim=""><meta itemProp="url" content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/1521/90/1843magazine.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/PostPresidency07x1280.jpg"/><img loading="lazy" width="1280" height="1521" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/1521/90/1843magazine.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/PostPresidency07x1280.jpg"  sizes="(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw" alt=""/></div></figure><p ><strong>The bricklayer</strong> Jimmy Carter <em>1977-81</em><br/> In the well-developed discourse around Donald Trump’s business interests, Jimmy Carter’s peanut farm has assumed a shimmering moral status. But the memes weren’t quite right. He didn’t sell it before entering the Oval Office. Instead, he avoided agricultural conflicts of interest by putting the family peanut farm into a blind trust.</p><p >After seeing Ronald Reagan inaugurated as <small>POTUS</small> in 1981 there was no sentimental return to the little legumes of Georgia. The business was $1m in debt. He sold it and wrote his way back to solvency with a literary output of baffling eclecticism: a frank and thoughtful memoir, some indifferent poetry and a children’s book, “The Little Baby Snoogle-Fleejer”, which lives up to the promise of the title.</p><p >Carter is the most tireless activist of all recent former presidents. He has been instrumental in the release of 50,000 political prisoners. He has mediated in diplomatic disputes, worked as an election monitor and won the Nobel peace prize. For three decades he has championed the housing initiative Habitat for Humanity and volunteered on its building sites, laying bricks and sawing joists into his mid-90s.</p><p >All this, and frugality too. He lives in a two-bedroom house worth $167,000, sometimes flies on commercial airlines and buys his clothes from discount shopping outlets. Before you sigh too deeply, he also gets the presidential pension and in 2o17 received $230,000 in taxpayer-funded travel and administrative expenses. That kind of money goes a long way at TJ Maxx.</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-6"></div></div></div><figure><div itemscope="" itemProp="image" itemType="https://schema.org/ImageObject" data-slim=""><meta itemProp="url" content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/979/90/1843magazine.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/PostPresidency08x1280.jpg"/><img loading="lazy" width="1280" height="979" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/979/90/1843magazine.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/PostPresidency08x1280.jpg"  sizes="(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw" alt=""/></div></figure><p ><strong>The smooth talker</strong> Bill Clinton <em>1993-2001</em><br/> “I left the White House $16m in debt,” said Bill Clinton, in an interview with <small>NBC</small> in 2018. He didn’t itemise the bill, but any such document would have listed his defence lawyers, Monica Lewinsky, Gennifer Flowers and Larry Klayman, a cranky litigator for whom suing the Clintons remains a vocation.</p><p >Fortunately, Bill and Hillary Clinton are fundraisers of genius. It took them just four years to restore the balance to zero. Some of this credit came from writing. Bill Clinton got a $15m advance for his 2004 memoir, “My Life”. (Later, Hillary’s “Hard Choices” brought in $8m.) Talking gave them their most bubbling stream of income, though. In his first year out of office, Bill Clinton gave 57 speeches. He lectured in Stockholm, Vienna and Warsaw ($180,000 a time), Milan ($350,000) and Salem, Massachusetts ($125,000).</p><p >Hillary Clinton’s presidential bid exposed this part of their careers to further scrutiny. Between 2001 and 2015, it emerged, the couple earned some $154m for speaking engagements. ($132,022,000 for him, $21,648,000 for her.) The money was helpful to the second presidential candidate in the relationship, but the client list wasn’t exactly a vote-winner when it emerged. Bernie Democrats were unlikely to feel true love for a nominee who’d dined with <small>UBS</small>, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Citibank and Merrill Lynch, without the use of a long spoon.</p><figure><div itemscope="" itemProp="image" itemType="https://schema.org/ImageObject" data-slim=""><meta itemProp="url" content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/904/90/1843magazine.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/PostPresidency09x1280V2.jpg"/><img loading="lazy" width="1280" height="904" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/904/90/1843magazine.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/PostPresidency09x1280V2.jpg"  sizes="(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw" alt=""/></div></figure><p ><strong>The painter</strong> George W. Bush <em>2001-09</em><br/> The evidence came in a series of private emails leaked in 2013 by a Romanian hacker called Guccifer. It was all about the oil. Phthalo green. Burnt sienna. Titanium buff. Other colours, too, applied to the canvas to produce a series of unique presidential portraits – the Bush knees emerging from the bathwater; the Bush back, hairless under the shower.</p><p >Once George W. Bush’s private passion was exposed the critics rang in their reviews. One said it was the art Forrest Gump would have painted, but this seemed to be more a comment on Bush’s somnolent accent than his work, which, thanks to the publication of “Portraits of Courage: A Commander in Chief’s Tribute to American Warriors”, is now an engine of fundraising for veterans’ charities. (The book was a Number 1 Amazon bestseller.)</p><p >Other former presidents have also dabbled with the paintbrush. Eisenhower exhibited his landscapes but was under few illusions about their quality. (“They would have burned this [expletive] a long time ago if I weren’t the president of the United States,” he told a reporter.) Carter once auctioned one of his timid nature studies to raise $525,000 for his own foundation. Bush, though, has shown the deepest commitment to art. He began taking lessons in 2012. “Gail,” he said to his teacher, “there’s a Rembrandt trapped in this body…Your job is to liberate him.”</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-7"></div></div></div><p >That being remains confined, but something else escaped. Bush’s preoccupation with the figurative, his rejection of the conceptual and his amateur-but-serious approach earned him the approval of the Stuckists, an international art movement founded in 1999 by a British painter Billy Childish. “The Stuckist Manifesto” declares: “The Stuckist is not a career artist but rather an amateur (<em>amare</em>, Latin, to love) who takes risks on the canvas rather than hiding behind ready-made objects (eg, a dead sheep).” If history is not kind to George W. Bush, perhaps theory will be.</p><figure><div itemscope="" itemProp="image" itemType="https://schema.org/ImageObject" data-slim=""><meta itemProp="url" content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/917/90/1843magazine.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/PostPresidency10x1280.jpg"/><img loading="lazy" width="1280" height="917" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/917/90/1843magazine.static-economist.com/sites/default/files/PostPresidency10x1280.jpg"  sizes="(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw" alt=""/></div></figure><p ><strong>The producers</strong> Barack Obama <em>2009-17</em><br/> Unlike many of their predecessors, the Obamas left the White House neither exhausted nor broke. Too young to retire, too virtuous to hide, too popular to fade away, the last four years demonstrate how much their hard power, which left them in 2016, was independent of their soft power, which remains undiminished. And they came as a package. In 2018 the pair signed a high, eight-figure production deal with Netflix. On their first slate – a biopic of Frederick Douglass, a 19th-century statesman and abolitionist.</p><p >Then there was their literary output, channelled through the biggest book deal in history – $65m for a memoir each. Surprisingly, the content is not about revealing the White House behind closed doors, setting the record straight or musing on geopolitics. It’s a form of self-help literature.</p><p >Squint at a copy of Michelle Obama’s “Becoming”, the top-selling book of 2018, and you might mistake it for a box of scented tea-lights. Open it up and you’ll find a survival kit for those who felt their own sense of ease and agency ebb away as its author and her husband drove out of the White House.<span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p><p ><small>Images: Getty, The Metropolitan Museum of Art, Library of Congress, Courtesy of Grant Miller/George W.
