An easy one—the answer is 2021. What about Expo 2020 in Dubai? An answer of 2021 would score a point, but so would 2022; it runs from October to March. How about Miss America 2020? That is a trick question. The event took place in December 2019, before coronavirus turned the world upside down. It is Miss America 2021 that has been cancelled.</p><p >Many other annual events will try to pick up where they left off in 2019. But organisers of less regular events are hoping to go ahead with the ones postponed from 2020, and hope the punters will put up with outdated merchandise. Some, such as Euro 2020, a quadrennial football tournament, have retained the same name. UEFA, the European football confederation, says this is “to keep the original vision of the tournament” and to “serve as a reminder of how the whole football family came together”. But it admits that “a lot of branded material had already been produced.” The same considerations no doubt apply to Expo 2020 and the 2020 Olympics.</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p >A sense of déjà vu is already setting in, and 2021 has not even started yet. In July 2019 Tokyo held a celebration to mark the one-year countdown to its big Olympic moment. There were fireworks, celebrities and an unveiling of the medals to be awarded at the games the following year. But the only thing that happened 366 days later was a 15-minute event in an empty stadium to mark, well, another year to the 2020 Olympics. Call it a twice-in-a-lifetime experience.</p><p >In cricket, the 2020 Twenty20 World Cup has been moved to 2021, causing anguish to fans of linguistic reduplication everywhere (Twenty20 is a shortened form of the game involving 20 overs for each team). Worse still, the original 2020 Twenty20, which was to have been played in Australia, will be held in India instead—whereas the 2021 series, to have been played in India, will occur in Australia in 2022. It is almost as confusing as the rules of cricket. Almost.</p><p >Live music has been affected, too. Among the many stars who have had to postpone tours by a year are Pearl Jam, Green Day and Alanis Morissette, on her “Jagged Little Pill” 25th-anniversary tour. As if switching between 2020 and 2021 were not taxing enough, it is strange to be reminded that some people still live in 1995. Meanwhile, on the Isle of Wight, a quirky English holiday spot and festival venue, the “Experience 1970 Festival” was postponed, too—proving that time travel never quite works out as intended. </p><p >It is not just fun stuff that has been put off to a later date. The 2nd Global Policy Forum on Memory of the World, which was originally scheduled for May 2020, has been postponed—no one can say until when. An interdisciplinary conference on “Confronting Evil”, planned for June 2020, is “under review”.</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p >Then there is politics, which never stops. Londoners who had hoped to ignore the 2020 mayoral elections will now have to extend their apathy for a further year. Hong Kongers preparing to vote in the city’s legislative-council elections will have had a particularly rough 12 months in which to make up their minds. And Somalis, having gone 51 years without elections based on the universal franchise, will have to wait yet another year.</p><p >No doubt 2020 will be chiefly remembered for the onset of the covid-19 pandemic. Yet here, too, the year gets short shrift. Like the absent father whose only contribution is one night of transmission and a surname, 2019 escaped the consequences, but left behind its legacy: covid-19 is so named because it was brought to the World Health Organisation’s attention on the last day of that year.</p><p ><strong>Let’s try that again<br/></strong>Even the very name of the virus evokes déjà vu. Back in 2002-03 the world confronted severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS. It was confined to fewer than 9,000 cases by 2004, and has happily not been heard of again. The virus that causes covid-19 is SARS-CoV-2—one of those unpopular sequels that nobody asked for.</p><p >Yet that also offers some reason for cheer. Humanity has already beaten a deadly coronavirus once. It can surely do so again, albeit on a bigger budget and with more drama, as is the way with sequels. Of all the things that will be repeated in 2021—including, quite possibly, the cancellation or postponement of events that were already delayed from 2020—containing a coronavirus is the one thing everybody would agree is even better the second time around.<span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p><p ><em>This article appeared in the Leaders section of the print edition of The World in 2021 under the headline “The year of déjà vu”</em></p>
