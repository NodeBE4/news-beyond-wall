Bells rang over the Paris skyline in the gloaming. People danced in the streets in Houston. Whoops echoed through Manhattan’s concrete canyons. A parade of cars, horns honking in joy, drove through streets thronged with cheering people outside the White House. Boris Johnson, Britain’s prime minister, congratulated Mr Biden and Kamala Harris—who will become the first female, black and Asian-American vice-president. Emmanuel Macron, France’s president, quickly followed suit, as did other world leaders.</p><p ><span>Donald Trump, in contrast, released a statement as ungracious as it was predictable. The president accused Mr Biden of “falsely pos[ing] as the winner”, and claimed his campaign wanted “ballots counted even if they are fraudulent, manufactured or cast by ineligible or deceased voters”. Not a shred of evidence exists for any of those accusations, and the more Mr Trump makes them the more insubstantial and churlish they seem. Whether he likes it or not, a presidential transition is already under way. How much sand can he throw in its gears? That depends in part on how much loyalty Mr Trump can still command across the government, on the success of his (increasingly desperate) lawsuits and on whether he devotes himself to frustrating the incoming administration—or simply rage-tweets his way through the next few weeks.</span></p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p ><span>Until 1933 the president was inaugurated in March, giving an incoming administration five months of planning time. It now has around 11 weeks. The Presidential Transition Act, which Congress passed in 1963 to try to forestall “</span><span>results detrimental to the safety and well-being of the United States and its people” during the transition</span><span>, establishes a framework. Before the election, each federal agency must designate a career official to head transition planning, and ensure continuity as political appointees depart. Six months before the election, the White House must create a White House Transition Coordinating Council (Mr Trump’s is led by Mark Meadows, his chief of staff, who tested positive for covid-19 this week).</span></p><p ><span>That council works with the incoming president’s team—headed in this case by Ted Kaufman, a longtime Biden confidant who led his vice-presidential transition 12 years ago. Mr Biden’s team, which currently has around 75 members but is expected to quadruple in size shortly, has thousands of square feet of office space available at the Commerce Department, though how much of that is being used amid the pandemic is unclear.</span></p><p ><span>Among the areas of greatest concern, because of the potential for harm during periods of disruption, is national security. The Transition Act requires the current administration to brief the incoming one on national-security threats and on covert or military operations. Mr Biden began receiving classified intelligence briefings in September. The outgoing and incoming administrations conduct joint preparedness exercises, and the National Security Council staff usually writes memos for the incoming administration. Some members of staff even stay on. National security seems among the areas where Mr Trump could do the least harm. Not only do intelligence professionals tend to be apolitical, but as vice-president and chair of the Senate Foreign Relations committee, Mr Biden has the advantage of both long-standing relationships and a deep knowledge of the subject.</span></p><p ><span>At least publicly, Mr Biden’s team have praised the Trump administration’s co-operation—though the General Services Administration, the federal government’s procurement and administrative agency, has yet to release millions of dollars in transition funds, which it says it will do once a winner has been “ascertained”. That could be quite soon, in the absence of a serious and credible challenge to the results. In 2000 the money was not released until after Al Gore conceded, on December 13th. That seems unlikely this year. Mr Trump’s campaign has filed a bevy of lawsuits, some of which have already been tossed out, and none of which is likely to change the result.</span></p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p ><span>But Mr Trump’s administration can still choose its level of co-operation during the transition. It could do the bare minimum. Typically, for instance, the outgoing president and first lady welcome their incoming counterparts about a week after the election; nobody would be surprised if Mr and Mrs Trump did not do so. Similarly, the tradition of presidents leaving courteous, handwritten notes of encouragement for their successors appears likely to fall by the wayside this time around. </span></p><p ><span>That would not be the first breach of decorum. Bill Clinton’s White House staff removed the W keys from many of their computer keyboards before surrendering them to George W. Bush’s administration. Franklin Roosevelt called his predecessor, Herbert Hoover, a “fat, timid capon”; their first meeting was reportedly awkward. By most accounts the best transitions were the two most recent ones; both Mr Bush and Barack Obama prided themselves on leaving things in good order.</span></p><p ><span>For Mr Biden, much of the time between now and the inauguration will be given to deciding on his cabinet and other political appointments—though, given the need for Senate confirmation, how much leeway he has will depend on the results of two Senate run-off elections in Georgia in early January. Mitch McConnell, the Republican Senate majority leader, has vowed to block any appointee he dislikes. That could scupper, for instance, the appointment of Susan Rice, who clashed with Republicans during the Obama administration, as secretary of state; or Sally Yates, whom Mr Trump dismissed from the Justice Department for insubordination, as attorney general. But with two wins in Georgia, Democrats would control the Senate, rendering Mr McConnell’s views irrelevant.</span></p><p ><span>Even then, however, Mr Biden is unlikely to stuff his cabinet with hard lefties, not being one himself. He is an institutionalist and ran on a message of unification. In his speech on November 7th, he sounded a familiar theme: “I pledge to be a president who seeks not to divide, but to unify—who doesn’t see red states or blue states, only sees the United States.” Barack Obama struck a similar tone when he announced his candidacy 16 years ago. That was before Mr Trump spent four years doing precisely the opposite—deepening divisions, pouring fuel on fires and salt into wounds for political gain. Mr Biden’s was a standard speech, a paean to what used to be commonplace for an American politician: gauzy unity, hope and progress, America as a beacon for the world. But after four years of chaos and cruelty, incompetence and solipsism, it sounded like what America voted for. It sounded like renewal.</span></p>
