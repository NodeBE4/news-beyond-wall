At 11am sharp on April 19th Germany’s Green Party anointed Annalena Baerbock as its first-ever candidate for the chancellorship, which will be vacated when Angela Merkel steps down after an election in September. Ms Baerbock, a 40-year-old MP, had won the agreement of Robert Habeck, the co-leader with whom she has helped turn the Greens from electoral also-rans to potential leaders of government. The process was smoothly organised, its result clearly communicated. Ms Baerbock’s approval at a party congress in June will be a formality.</p><p >Meanwhile Germany’s ruling conservatives—Mrs Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and its Bavarian ally, the Christian Social Union (CSU)—were locked in vicious battle over their own candidate choice. On April 20th, after a week of grinding negotiations, Markus Söder, the CSU boss, finally yielded to Armin Laschet, his less popular CDU counterpart. Mr Laschet begins his candidacy facing a wall of scepticism within his ranks and beyond. The process was “self-destructive”, laments Karin Prien, a member of the CDU board, though she expects the wounds to heal.</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p >All Germany’s big parties now have their candidates in place. (Last year the Social Democrats, junior coalition partner to the CDU/CSU, nominated Olaf Scholz, the finance minister and vice-chancellor.) Mrs Merkel’s departure means the campaign will be the first without a sitting chancellor since the founding of the post-war republic. It is also shaping up to be the most compelling for a generation.</p><p >Each party will stake a competing claim to Germany’s Mitte (middle), a concept that occupies an almost mystical importance in the country’s political psyche. Mr Laschet is often seen as the CDU’s continuity candidate. He backed Mrs Merkel during the refugee crisis, her most fragile moment, though he has clashed with her during the pandemic. He follows CDU orthodoxy on fiscal matters and is sceptical about vigorous measures to curb climate change. Mr Scholz presents himself as a safe pair of hands with a mild social-democratic tinge. Experienced, reassuring and defiantly dull, his biggest challenge is his fractious party’s stubbornly low polling.</p><p >Ms Baerbock, a little-known party insider until she won the co-leadership in 2018, is an altogether different prospect. Her candidacy involves two bets. First, that 16 years of Merkelism and a year of a sometimes badly managed pandemic have given a large portion of the country an appetite for change. Second, that Ms Baerbock, who combines centrist policy inclinations with an optimistic style of communication, is a credible advocate for it. In a breezy, almost patriotic acceptance speech she celebrated German innovations, from the bicycle to covid-19 vaccines, adding that “changes would have to be made”.</p><p >This message will be bolstered by the optics of an energetic, youngish woman campaigning against older, male members of a coalition that long ago ran out of steam. For voters tired of the status quo, Greens hope that Ms Baerbock’s total lack of governing experience can be turned to her advantage. “She is the perfect match for this challenge,” says Jamila Schäfer, the party’s deputy chairwoman.</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p >The Greens’ draft manifesto is brimming with ideas, from cranking up Germany’s climate-change ambitions to loosening debt rules and raising taxes to fund a public-investment splurge. All this comes wrapped in a more inclusive approach to politics. Ms Baerbock and Mr Habeck have cultivated links with business and reached out to parts of Germany where the party has typically lagged, such as the east, albeit with mixed results. Most Greens are careful to avoid the scolding tone on cars or dietary habits that once earned them a damaging reputation as a “party of bans”. “We want to change political and economic rules, not change the individual,” says Sven-Christian Kindler, a Green MP.</p><p >The Green claim to have identified a new Mitte is not unjustified. Before the pandemic Germans often said climate was their top political concern. Some 30% say they can imagine voting Green (the party currently enjoys around 22% support, a few points behind the CDU/CSU). The Greens are an established governing party, part of coalitions in 11 of Germany’s 16 states, running a range of ministries and working with almost all the other parties.</p><p >The Greens’ new approach is also reflected in the leaders’ management of the party, argues Ellen Ueberschär of the Green-linked Heinrich Böll Foundation. Last year Ms Baerbock and Mr Habeck hailed the CDU’s “legendary” pragmatism, a habit they have inculcated among their own. Internal rows and raucous party congresses are largely history. “At 8.9% [the party’s share of the vote in 2017] we cannot change the big issues we stand for,” Ms Baerbock recently told an interviewer. Now everything is subordinated to the goal of winning power. This includes abiding splits on foreign policy, defence and trade, papered over with tortuous sentences in the draft manifesto.</p><p >Mr Laschet, who says the Greens are the CDU’s main rival, is likely to stress Ms Baerbock’s inexperience and the risk that she may seek to lead a left-wing coalition. Yet he will have to restrain his attacks. While Ms Baerbock may enjoy several coalition options after the election, the CDU/CSU has no realistic path to retaining power without the Greens as (probably) its junior partner. It has also yet to publish a manifesto.</p><p >True, Mr Laschet has often exceeded expectations, and much can happen in five months. Yet Mrs Merkel’s party is struggling to explain why it deserves to outlast her in office. In the Greens, it faces a serious challenge to its ability to do so. </p>
