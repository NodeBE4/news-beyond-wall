For years, unconventional, ultra-loose monetary policy has pumped up asset values without pushing consumer prices beyond central bankers’ targets. The belief that both interest rates and inflation will stay low has fed investors’ enthusiasm. But recently that faith has wavered. The prospect of America’s enormous <a href="https://www.economist.com/leaders/2021/02/06/why-joe-bidens-proposed-stimulus-is-too-big">stimulus package</a>—which Congress passed on March 10th—plus concerns over the direction of monetary policy have caused gyrations in America’s financial markets. How likely is inflation to rise, and should investors be concerned? </p><p >The latest bout of jitters began on March 4th, after comments by Jerome Powell, the chair of the Federal Reserve. Mr Powell persisted with his pledge to preserve a loose monetary stance even as growth rebounds and inflation rises with it. But he didn’t talk down a recent rise in bond yields, taking investors by surprise. Markets wobbled. Bond prices dropped and yields spiked (the two travel in opposite directions) and equity markets fell. The next day a bumper jobs report—bringing more evidence of a strong recovery—spurred renewed selling of Treasury bonds. Then there is the further, $1.9trn-sized reason why the bond market has been worrying: Joe Biden’s stimulus package, intended to counteract the ill-effects of coronavirus. When its effects are felt in America’s already resurgent economy, inflation hawks fear higher consumer prices, sending <a href="https://www.economist.com/leaders/2021/02/10/how-rising-inflation-could-disrupt-the-worlds-economic-policies">ripples around the world</a>. </p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p >Doves might counter that a little inflation is no bad thing. Since economic growth and faster rises in consumer prices often come as a pair, the latter can be taken as a marker of economic health. In many advanced economies, moreover, sustained inflation is not a serious risk. Although euro-zone inflation jumped to 0.9% in January and February, from -0.3% in December, one-off factors including a rise in energy costs were at play. The surge is unlikely to last beyond this year. </p><p >Sustained inflation is a somewhat more credible threat in America. The coming months are all but certain to bring a jump in the annual inflation rate—which rose by 0.3 percentage points to 1.7% in February—given that prices were depressed last year by the pandemic. The latest stimulus will give most Americans $1,400, on top of the fiscal transfers that they have already received. Consumers are saving much of the cash, creating a pile of pent-up savings. No one knows <a href="https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2021/03/09/the-worlds-consumers-are-sitting-on-a-pile-of-cash-will-they-spend-it">how much of this will be spent</a> as the economy opens up, helped by vaccination of more people. But a good share of it has gone to ordinary Americans, who tend to spend a greater proportion of any extra money they get than the very well-off. That could set off a consumer boom in the second half of 2021, forcing up prices.</p><p >How would the Fed respond? Last year it adopted a new regime of “average inflation targeting”. This grants the central bank leeway not to raise interest rates until inflation exceeds 2%, the long-standing target. But it does not allow for a large or protracted overshoot. If the Fed feels compelled to tamp down an <a href="https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2021/01/19/will-joe-bidens-fiscal-stimulus-overheat-the-american-economy">overheating economy</a> accompanied by a burst of inflation, the consequences would be far-reaching. Raising interest rates sooner might mean the peak in interest rates is higher. The risk of another recession would grow. Tighter monetary policy could puncture America’s bubbly stockmarkets.</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p >The impact would extend well beyond American shores. The assumption of continued loose financial conditions is supporting asset prices around the world. It underlies emerging markets’ experimentation with unconventional monetary policy and bigger deficits pioneered in the rich world. They could suffer capital outflows if high interest rates in America push up the dollar (<a href="https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2021/03/06/which-emerging-markets-are-most-exposed-to-a-treasury-tantrum">four countries look particularly fragile</a>). Their finances would suffer, compounding the difficulty of fighting the pandemic. The future of inflation is uncertain, but the consequences of too much could be severe. It is a risk worth worrying about.</p><br><hr><div>获取更多RSS：<br><a href="https://feedx.net" style="color:orange" target="_blank">https://feedx.net</a> <br><a href="https://feedx.top" style="color:orange" target="_blank">https://feedx.top</a><br></div>
