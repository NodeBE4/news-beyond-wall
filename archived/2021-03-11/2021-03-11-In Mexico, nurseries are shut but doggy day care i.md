She shuts the front door and turns to homeschooling her two children. For Mila is not a child, but the family dog.</p><p >Schools and nurseries have been shut in Mexico for a year, thanks to the pandemic and overmighty teachers’ unions. But doggy day care is booming. Canine carers offer claw-trims and let beloved pets frolic outdoors. “Many clients now have a home office or are worried about their dogs becoming too attached to them,” explains Montserrat Mondragón, the co-owner of Casa Pek, a dog day-care centre, as she strokes a tiny pooch on her lap. One facility in the rich neighbourhood of La Condesa also has a camp where mutts can spend a relaxing weekend in the countryside.</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p >The number of dogs in Mexico increased by 20% in the decade to 2018, to nearly 20m. Most are strays, but many have found loving homes. They account for 85% of all pets in Mexico. Parks have “canine areas”. Many restaurants welcome dogs and provide drinking water. Pet beauty salons provide not only baths and trims but massages and acupuncture, too. None of this is cheap. Casa Pek charges 300 pesos ($14) per day. A “relaxing bath” at PetCare, a salon, can cost more than an average worker’s daily wages.</p><p >Mexico’s rising passion for dogs has coincided with falling human fertility. In the mid-1980s a Mexican woman could expect to have four children; now, only two. In the long run, as people have grown richer and the returns to education have risen, families have shrunk. In the past year, however, it is economic uncertainty that has prompted many to delay having sprogs.</p><p >For some, a dog is a lovable substitute. The most devoted owners buy clothes and prams and throw birthday parties for their pooches, with hats and birthday cakes (beef or tuna flavour, often bone-shaped). Ice-cream parlours sell <em>helados</em> for hounds; some restaurants even offer a full doggy menu. All this furry infantilisation has inspired a portmanteau word, <em>perrhijo</em>, a fusion of the Spanish for “dog” and “child”.</p><p >Mexico’s pampered pets are probably enjoying the pandemic more than its locked-down kids. By one estimate, nearly two-thirds of the children who have missed a year of school because of coronavirus live in Latin America or the Caribbean. For mothers such as Ms Rountree Antón, doggy day care offers some respite from covid-induced drudgery. But she will not stop worrying until her children, too, are let off the leash and back into the classroom. <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p><p data-test-id="Footnote" >This article appeared in the The Americas section of the print edition under the headline &quot;The dogs are all right&quot;</p>
