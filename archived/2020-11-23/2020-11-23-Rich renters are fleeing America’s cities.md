Low interest rates have kept the rich world’s housing markets bubbling. In America’s biggest cities, prices were 5.2% higher in August than a year before, according to Standard &amp; Poor’s Case-Shiller index. For Americans who rent rather than own, however, the pandemic has been less benign. Fully 49% of renting households lost income between March and September, compared with 36% of homeowners, according to the Census Bureau. And competition for affordable homes is growing. A new <a href="https://www.economist.comhttps://www.jchs.harvard.edu/state-nations-housing-2020">report</a> by researchers at Harvard University finds that only the most well-off renters will benefit from the impact of the pandemic on the rental market.</p><p >The researchers examined price and occupancy data on 12.6m rental apartments from CoStar, a property-research company. Over the past decade, the rent charged on apartments has increased by around 2% a year on average, regardless of the type of property. The pandemic has made that growth more uneven. In the summer average rents shrank, compared with a year earlier, for the first time in more than a decade (see chart). That was because the poshest pads became cheaper. Rents for properties at the top of CoStar’s building-rating scale, which takes into account factors such as design and amenities, fell by 2% year on year. The lower end of the market held up better, with rents for less plush apartments rising by about 2% in the same period as demand for cheaper homes increased.</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p >The decline in rents for the smartest properties reflects a softening in demand. This summer vacancies in high-density urban areas such as Manhattan rose by three percentage points on average compared with a year earlier. This may in turn reflect new ways of living. With offices, bars and restaurants shut, city life, and the accompanying expense, has lost its lustre. Working from home has prodded people to reconsider where they want to live. Young renters have also returned to their family homes, helping to push up vacancies in cities. This summer the share of 18- to 29-year-olds living with their parents reached its highest level since the Depression.</p><p >People trying to save money on rent may struggle to find cheap places to live. The authors note that the number of properties in America available to rent for under $600 a month fell by 2.5m between 2004 and 2019, whereas those costing at least $1,000 a month rose by 10.4m. The pandemic has only made the search for an affordable home harder.</p>
