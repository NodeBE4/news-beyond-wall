Every time a virus replicates, changes can creep into its genetic material. The more viral replication there is, the greater the chances that mutations will arise. And change brings potential problems in the fight against SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes covid-19. Predictably, variants of the coronavirus have started to appear in several parts of the world. One, first detected in Britain in September, is believed to be 50-70% more transmissible than the original, or wild-type, virus. Another, identified in South Africa a month later, has been linked to higher viral load—the amount of virus present in someone’s blood—which makes it easier for it to spread. Two other variants emerged in America (July) and Brazil and Japan (January). There is no evidence to suggest that the variants found so far are more deadly than the wild-type, but experts are increasingly worried that they may be more likely to evade existing vaccines.</p><p >In many ways the world has been lucky: SARS-CoV-2 has mutated at a much slower pace than other viruses, such as those that cause influenza. This may be because of its ability to repair some genetic errors as it replicates. Even so, the variants that have arisen are cause for concern because some mutations involve the gene that codes for the viral spike protein. Crucially, this structure is the means by which the virus gains entry to, and infects, human cells. The variant of the virus found in Britain, B.1.1.7, comprises 23 mutations, but only two have been linked to greater infectiousness. One helps lock the spike onto its target on the cell surface, a receptor protein called ACE2. The variant found in South Africa, B.1.351, has fewer mutations but at least three appear to be more resistant to the antibodies that humans have developed to the wild-type virus. These sorts of changes have caused concern that the variant might be able to evade any immunity people had gained from previous infections or vaccination. </p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p >According to America’s Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, variants of the virus will need to accumulate multiple mutations in the spike protein to evade vaccine-induced immunity. The result of trials announced on January 28th showed that a jab made by Novavax, an American pharma firm, was almost 90% effective in preventing symptoms of covid-19 in Britain, and 60% effective in South Africa. A similar result was found when Johnson &amp; Johnson, another American firm, tested its single-dose vaccine in the same two countries and Latin America: it was less effective in South Africa. This suggests that the B.1.351 variant is less amenable to existing vaccines than its predecessor. Even so, the vaccines worked well enough to prevent it from causing serious disease in most cases. </p><p >Vaccine-makers will have to continue adapting their vaccines to keep up with mutations in the coming years. This may be by providing booster shots tailored to different variants, or by creating a “bivalent” vaccine, ie, one that works against the original strain and a mutant. Moderna is planning to work on a booster that will amp up the body’s immune response to B.1.351 and could work in combination with all of the leading vaccine candidates. Research is set to begin in July and should be completed within a year. Pfizer-BioNTech says it can create a jab adapted to the variants in six weeks. America’s Food and Drug Administration, the world’s leading drug regulator, has promised a “streamlined” process for authorising updated vaccines. This would not involve full-scale phase-3 trials for efficacy, but rather some smaller trials to make sure the vaccine triggers a similar immune response. </p><p >Scientists are still learning about the new variants and how they behave. Ultimately the best way to stop a virus from evolving is to stop it from spreading by whatever means available. All the more reason to vaccinate as quickly, and as widely, as possible. </p>
