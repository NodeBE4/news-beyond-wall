Stockmarkets, however, responded with a mere golf clap. The <small>S&amp;P</small> 500, a technology-heavy index of big American firms, rose by just 1.2% that day.</p><p >There are at least two plausible explanations for this muted reaction. One is that investors already expected such success. Although markets’ views on vaccine prospects cannot be measured directly, Good Judgment, a consultancy that uses a group of “superforecasters” to make predictions, offers a proxy. In April it began publishing a daily probability that enough vaccines to inoculate 25m Americans will be distributed by March 31st 2021. When Pfizer released its results, the forecasters raised this value from 53% to 88%, showing that the outcome was indeed a surprise. (Pfizer’s own shares also rose by 7.7% on the news.)</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p >That leaves the other probable cause of the markets’ mixed signals: a successful vaccine may not help companies that have benefited from social changes caused by covid-19. In one study testing this theory, Goldman Sachs, a bank, analysed how shares in each industry had responded to shifts in the odds of an early-arriving vaccine. It found that technology companies, whose products have enjoyed faster adoption during lockdowns, lagged behind the market when vaccine prospects improved. Conversely, energy and materials firms rallied the most under such conditions.</p><p >To expand on this research, we have applied its “excess return” calculation—performance relative to market averages—to all listed firms worldwide worth at least $10bn, on every day since April 27th. We then measured the relationship between each company’s excess returns and daily changes in the superforecasters’ estimated probability of mass vaccination by March 2021. Finally, we grouped the results by industry, breaking out the sub-sectors most likely to show large effects.</p><p >This method yielded a more intuitive list of winners and losers. Hotel, restaurant and airline shares have traded closely in line with the vaccine’s estimated arrival date. In contrast, consumer-durables firms—including manufacturers of swimming-pool supplies, appliances and exercise bicycles—tended to trail behind the market when vaccine producers made breakthroughs, and beat it when they suffered setbacks. Health-care stocks (save those of vaccine makers themselves), and technology and e-commerce firms buoyed by lockdowns, also showed this pattern.</p><figure  data-infographic-></figure><figure><iframe height="NaN" src="https://infographics.economist.com/2020/20201205_GDC100_2/index.html" data-size="full-width"></iframe></figure><p >However, we also found more surprising results. Financial firms’ fortunes tend to mirror the broader economy, but the link between progress on vaccines and financial stock returns was unusually strong—nearly as robust as for leisure companies. Banks, which have made big provisions for loan defaults, would enjoy a windfall if such losses do not occur. And credit-card issuers like American Express will gain from the return of international travel.</p><p >Meanwhile, retailers’ share performance has been curiously uncorrelated to vaccine news. When Pfizer announced its results, shares of discount department stores like Burlington, Ross and <small>TJX</small> surged. However, those of big-box stores such as Best Buy and Target sold off—perhaps because investors expected consumers to switch to other types of spending once they feel safe travelling and mingling again. <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p><p data-interactive- >Sources: Good Judgment; Bloomberg; <i>The Economist</i></p><figure data-infographic-js="1"></figure><p data-test-id="Footnote" >This article appeared in the Graphic detail section of the print edition under the headline &quot;What goes up&quot;</p>
