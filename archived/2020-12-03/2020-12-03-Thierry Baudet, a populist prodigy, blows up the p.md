The Chopin-playing Dutch intellectual, then 31, had written a book denouncing the <small>EU</small>. Two years later he co-founded a party, Forum For Democracy (<small>FVD</small>), which won the largest vote-share in provincial elections in 2019. In a speech that night Mr Baudet described it as a world-historical turning point, invoking Hegel’s “owl of Minerva”, a symbol of wisdom that “spreads its wings only [at] dusk”.</p><p >This month the <small>FVD</small> blew itself up in a series of scandals, and music again played a role. At a dinner on November 20th a newly recruited politician wanted to play 1980s disco. Mr Baudet insisted on classical. Soon, says an <small>FVD</small> senator who later quit the party, Mr Baudet was ranting that covid-19 was a plot by George Soros. He answered worries about anti-Semitism in the party by saying that “almost everyone I know is anti-Semitic.” (He later repudiated these statements, but did not explain what he had meant.)</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p >The next day a newspaper published chats full of racist and anti-Semitic vitriol among <small>FVD</small>’s youth wing, run by Mr Baudet’s ally, Freek Jansen. Rather than fire Mr Jansen, Mr Baudet quit as parliamentary leader. But he stayed on as an <small>MP</small>, and said he would return as leader if members asked. The <small>FVD</small>’s provincial and city office-holders began deserting the party. So did its other <small>MP</small> and most of its senators, including Paul Cliteur, a legal philosopher whose department at the University of Leiden served as <small>FVD</small>’s intellectual breeding ground.</p><p >As recently as March polls gave <small>FVD</small> about 11% of the vote. But as Mr Baudet flirted with covid-19 conspiracy nutjobbery, its support slid to around 3%. Many who once thought Mr Baudet merely provocative now see him as a dangerous crank. Henk Otten, a senator and one of the party’s co-founders, was pushed out last year after warning that Mr Baudet was being radicalised. He says he has turned into a “fascist psychopath”.</p><p ><small>FVD</small>’s board says the party’s 40,000-odd members will vote on whether or not Mr Baudet should return. Mr Otten says the statutes do not provide for that. But Chris Aalberts, author of a book about the party, says its rules do not matter much: “It is a one-man system.” Mr Baudet may stay on as head of a rump <small>FVD</small> and win a few seats at the general election in March. Geert Wilders, the head of the Netherlands’ other far-right populist party, is overjoyed. As <small>FVD</small> has withered, its voters have come over to him.</p><p data-test-id="Footnote" >This article appeared in the Europe section of the print edition under the headline &quot;On the Chopin block&quot;</p><br><hr><div>获取更多RSS：<br><a href="https://feedx.net" style="color:orange" target="_blank">https://feedx.net</a> <br><a href="https://feedx.xyz" style="color:orange" target="_blank">https://feedx.xyz</a><br></div>
