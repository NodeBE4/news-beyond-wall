The character was the emblem and connective tissue of a franchise that now boasts 23 entries, a combined $23bn in box-office revenue and a Best Picture nomination at the Oscars (“Black Panther” was the first comic-book film to win such recognition). Along the way Marvel, which had barely escaped bankruptcy in the 1990s, was acquired by the Walt Disney Company in 2009 for $4bn. Now the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) is Disney’s biggest franchise. </p><p >Having conquered the box office, the MCU is now bringing new stories and spin-offs to the small screen. Disney executives are hoping that the franchise’s legions of fans will be tempted to subscribe to Disney+, the company’s streaming service. The platform has stunned Wall Street in its first year. Six months before Disney+ launched, Disney said it was targeting 60m-90m subscribers by 2024; in December the service had more than 80m users after only 13 months, leading Disney to increase its goal to between 230m and 260m. The company’s stock surged to an all-time high, despite the fact that its primary moneymakers—theme parks and theatrical films—are on pause. </p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p >“WandaVision”, the first show set in the MCU, had its premiere on Disney+ on January 15th. It was not the title Disney was planning to launch with: “Falcon &amp; The Winter Soldier”, a splashy action yarn which focused on the successor to Captain America, was the frontrunner until covid-related production shutdowns delayed the series from August 2020 to March 2021. “WandaVision” focuses on two secondary characters, Wanda Maximoff and The Vision, who have never been listed higher than eighth place in a Marvel film. (The Vision is the physical embodiment on Iron Man’s artificial-intelligence assistant.) </p><p >The show itself adopts a curious format: the protagonists are unwittingly trapped in a simulacra of hit television series from the 1960s, including “The Dick Van Dyke Show” and “Bewitched”. “WandaVision” apes the writing, black-and-white colouring, aspect ratio, set design, cinematography and laugh tracks of those programmes. Later episodes shift to more modern sitcom stylings, but after three (which is all that were released to critics) the stakes of the series, as well as the show’s role within the broader MCU, remain unclear. For many viewers, especially those who expected the first Marvel series to match the spectacle of “The Mandalorian”, a live-action “Star Wars” title, “WandaVision” may disappoint. </p><p >Of particular interest to fans, pundits and investors is whether Disney is going to oversaturate its most prized property. Within the next few years, Marvel plans to grow its annual output to four feature films a year and potentially as many original series, too. This is a big leap from the beginning of the MCU. Over the first “phase” of the Infinity Saga, which ran from 2008 to 2013, the MCU released 1.2 films per year and each grossed an average of $291m at the North American box office. But, so far at least, expansion has not been a problem for the MCU; on the contrary, more content has strengthened it. In the third phase, from 2016 through 2019, Marvel released 2.75 films per year and averaged $445m.</p><p >As part of this, Marvel has had to transform secondary or tertiary characters into popular figures. A decade ago, hardly anyone knew of the “Guardians of the Galaxy”, a team made up of an anthropomorphic tree that could only say his own name, a cybernetic talking racoon, a purple scarified alien incapable of understanding sarcasm, a green alien with a death wish and an intergalactic half-human, half-god scavenger. This is an important part of Marvel’s TV strategy, too, and the company argues that the series format can better develop fan interests in its less popular and newer heroes. This includes The Vision and Wanda Maximoff, both of whom originated in Silver Age of Comics of the late 1950s to the early 1970s, as well as Kamala Khan and Riri Williams, who first appeared in the 2010s. Khan is the first Muslim superhero to lead a Marvel comic and will have her own Disney+ series in 2021; Williams is a black teen who finds, wears and builds upon Iron Man’s suit. There are lots of characters for Marvel to use—between 5,000 and 6,000, according to some reports—meaning that the universe has plenty more room for expansion.</p>
