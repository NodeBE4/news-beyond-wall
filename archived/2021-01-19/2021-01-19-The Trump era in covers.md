The story of his presidency has been deeply unpredictable in many ways, starting with the fact that it happened at all. But the nature of his administration should not have surprised anyone: chaos and disruption characterised both his candidacy and his time as commander-in-chief. Mr Trump has made our cover many times in the past five-and-a-bit years; this selection reflects the drama and the essence of his tenure.</p><div ><figure><div itemscope="" itemProp="image" itemType="https://schema.org/ImageObject" data-slim="1"><meta itemProp="url" content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/800/90/sites/default/files/images/2021/01/articles/body/20210123_opd011.jpg"/><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/800/90/sites/default/files/images/2021/01/articles/body/20210123_opd011.jpg"  sizes="300px" alt=""/></div></figure><p >September 5th 2015: <a href="https://www.economist.com/weeklyedition/2015-09-05">Washington, we have a problem</a></p><p >When Mr Trump announced his candidacy for the presidency in June 2015, sophisticates scoffed. Even after leading the polls for the Republican nomination for weeks, many found it hard to take him seriously. But the possibility that he might win the presidency was <a href="https://www.economist.com/leaders/2015/09/05/trumps-america">no longer a joke</a>. “Demagogues in other countries sometimes win elections,” we wrote in our first cover devoted to Mr Trump, “and there is no compelling reason why America should always be immune.” </p></div><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-1"></div></div></div><div ><figure><div itemscope="" itemProp="image" itemType="https://schema.org/ImageObject" data-slim="1"><meta itemProp="url" content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/800/90/sites/default/files/images/2021/01/articles/body/20210123_opd012.jpg"/><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/800/90/sites/default/files/images/2021/01/articles/body/20210123_opd012.jpg"  sizes="300px" alt=""/></div></figure></div><p >November 12th 2016: <a href="https://www.economist.com/weeklyedition/2016-11-12">The Trump era</a></p><p >Mr Trump won the presidency on November 9th 2016. A campaign that flouted the rules of electioneering had <a href="https://www.economist.com/united-states/2016/11/12/how-it-happened">ended in triumph</a>, and flummoxed pollsters in the process. An era of uncertainty beckoned, for <a href="https://www.economist.com/briefing/2016/11/12/the-piecemaker">America’s allies</a> as well as its adversaries. In our cover leader in that week&#x27;s issue, we mulled whether America’s 45th president might become a more emollient figure in office than he had been on the trail. Our conclusion was pessimistic. “We are deeply sceptical that he will make a good president—because of his policies, his temperament and the demands of political office.”</p><figure><div itemscope="" itemProp="image" itemType="https://schema.org/ImageObject" data-slim="0"><meta itemProp="url" content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/1720/90/sites/default/files/images/2021/01/articles/body/20210123_opd013.png"/><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/1720/90/sites/default/files/images/2021/01/articles/body/20210123_opd013.png"  sizes="(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw" alt=""/></div></figure><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p >February 4th 2017: <a href="https://www.economist.com/weeklyedition/2017-02-04">An insurgent in the White House</a></p><p >When Mr Trump was inaugurated on January 20th 2017, the question was whether normal politics would be replaced by something different.

Heather Heyer, a protester, was killed when a white supremacist, since imprisoned for life, drove his car into her.

His slapping of tariffs on steel and aluminium imports, supposedly on national-security grounds, risked an escalating trade war with close allies. Mr Trump also hobbled the World Trade Organisation’s system of settling disputes. He didn’t manage to blow up the multilateral trading system. But he put it in peril.</p></div><div ><figure><div itemscope="" itemProp="image" itemType="https://schema.org/ImageObject" data-slim="1"><meta itemProp="url" content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/800/90/sites/default/files/images/2021/01/articles/body/20210123_opd017.jpg"/><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/800/90/sites/default/files/images/2021/01/articles/body/20210123_opd017.jpg"  sizes="300px" alt=""/></div></figure><p >April 21st 2018: <a href="https://www.economist.com/weeklyedition/2018-04-21">What has become of the Republican Party?</a></p><p >In April 2018 we lamented Mr Trump’s <a href="https://www.economist.com/briefing/2018/04/19/donald-trumps-takeover-of-his-party-is-near-complete">takeover of the Republican Party</a>. The party’s organising principle, we wrote, had become loyalty—not to an ideal or a legislative programme, but to one man and the rage of its voter base. The consequences were government by impulse, trashing of political convention and the denouncing of opponents as traitors. The best rebuke, we said, would be defeat at the ballot box; but responsibility also lay with Republicans who knew Mr Trump was bad for America.</p></div><div ><figure><div itemscope="" itemProp="image" itemType="https://schema.org/ImageObject" data-slim="1"><meta itemProp="url" content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/800/90/sites/default/files/images/2021/01/articles/body/20210123_opd018.jpg"/><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/800/90/sites/default/files/images/2021/01/articles/body/20210123_opd018.jpg"  sizes="300px" alt=""/></div></figure><p >June 9th 2018: <a href="https://www.economist.com/weeklyedition/2018-06-09">America’s foreign policy</a></p><p >Mr Trump headed to Singapore in June 2018 for a meeting with Kim Jong Un, North Korea’s dictator, seeking a deal to denuclearise the Korean peninsula.
