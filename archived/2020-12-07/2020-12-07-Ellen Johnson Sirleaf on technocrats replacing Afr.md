They demand governments that do not oppress but protect them, and that provide quality health care, education, transparent decision-making and responsible spending. Young people, who make up the majority of the population, want more political participation. One of the best things government leaders can do is to open the door to them—by way of the civil service.</p><p >Public leadership is about much more than political power. Effective, equitable public institutions are the product of thousands of small, daily actions by dedicated civil servants who aren’t in the headlines. They ensure access to medicines, classrooms, clean water and safe roads. They are the ones who protect the vital institutions of democracy. A new generation of technocrats must replace the kleptocrats of the past.</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p >But low salaries and lengthy waits for promotion often repel the best and brightest Africans from pursuing employment in the government sector. I know from experience that governments can change the perception that public-sector work is corrupt and uninspired, by creating and supporting civil-service jobs that offer professional development, promotions based on performance and real opportunities to create lasting change. This takes good policy, sufficient funding, bold ideas and creative partnerships.</p><p >Instead of trying to work around governments, the aid agencies, foundations and companies operating in Africa could partner with the public sector and commit funds annually to improve the education and training of young Africans and mid-career professionals to improve government effectiveness.</p><p >The right investment in talent, with funding from all partners, means that developing countries can establish an honest and effective civil service, so governments can fulfil their mandates. When I took office as the president of Liberia in 2006, we had to rebuild institutions that had been ravaged by conflict, corruption and neglect after a decade of civil war. We invested in people first, creating new ways for diverse, young, talented professionals to serve the country. We knew it would pay dividends for decades.</p><p >Liberia established a fellowship programme to recruit and train civil servants, helped by generous support from foreign-aid initiatives, charities and substantial spending from the national budget for personnel. We also set up a promotion system based on merit, created whistleblower protections and ensured that new civil servants were well-supervised, proactively mentored and part of a peer network holding them accountable for their actions.</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p >Professionalising the civil service and protecting it from the corruption and autocracy that have doomed it in the past has paid off. It has been a critical factor in Liberia’s progress on debt reform, health care, education, and peace and security. In a potent symbol of success, 86% of the programme’s fellows remained in the civil service after the transition to a new administration in 2018.</p><p >Today, a nonprofit group called <a href="https://www.economist.comhttps://www.emergingpublicleaders.org/">Emerging Public Leaders</a> (EPL), which I chair, has brought the Liberian fellowship model to Ghana and will soon expand to Kenya. Eventually, we want to create a pan-African network of young, public-service leaders and enable greater regional co-operation. As the covid-19 pandemic reminds us, trouble that is far away today may arrive on our doorstep tomorrow; the civil service plays a vital role in building trusted channels of communication not just within nations but between them.</p><p ><iframe height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PS9hlNhyRZY"></iframe></p><p >In crises, the wisdom of having a strong civil service is especially apparent. During the Ebola pandemic in 2014, these dedicated leaders were on the front lines of the response or keeping the engine of state running. Today, a new group of young civil servants across west Africa is bringing its skills to the fight against covid-19, while working to improve the access to and quality of community health care.</p><p >Vasco Ayere Avoka, an EPL fellow in Ghana’s health ministry, volunteered to be a contact tracer for covid-19 in Accra. Among hundreds of contact tracers, he was the only one with the computing and technical skills to synthesise the data they were gathering into useful statistics for setting policy. After two weeks in the field he was pulled into an analyst role to help senior leaders in the Ghana Health Service make decisions about where and how to deploy their contact-tracing teams.</p><p >He follows in the footsteps of Sarah Johnson, a Ministry of Finance fellow in Liberia, who was also supported by America’s Mandela Washington Fellowship programme for young African leaders. During the 2014 Ebola epidemic, she cleverly innovated by installing multi-tap water tanks in densely populated areas, which reduced the spread of the virus. Today she still serves in the Liberian government, as a senior policy adviser at the Ministry of Finance and Development Planning, improving the professionalism of the community-health workforce.</p><p >For a new model African civil service to be successful, political leaders must make government service a realistic, accessible and genuinely prestigious career choice for talented young people. We have to begin with the premise that government can and does work.</p><p >African leaders need to establish policies that recognise achievement and encourage integrity, collaboration and innovation. Open government policies in an increasingly digital Africa—such as putting ministry records online and passing “sunshine” laws for the public and press—can protect civil servants by making them accountable to the citizenry and not to elected or appointed authoritarians. The rewards for honest decisions should be clear and significant, and the consequences for corrupt behaviour strictly and impartially enforced. Civil-society groups and the media can help by “naming and faming” those who act with integrity. This won’t solve all problems, but it will be a step forward.</p><p >The vision of governments need to be broad and inclusive, to<a href="https://www.economist.comhttps://au.int/sites/default/files/documents/39165-doc-greaterinclusionofafricanyouthreportaugust2020.pdf">create opportunities</a> for those who are usually excluded, notably young women. Promoting and appointing women to positions of authority will address the gender imbalance that exists among elected leaders.</p><p >Fourteen years after I began my term as the first woman African head of state, not one other has been elected head of state on the continent (Ethiopia’s President Sahle-Work Zewde was appointed), and women are still sorely under-represented in all public institutions. <a href="https://www.economist.comhttps://www.ejscenter.org/programs/amujae-initiative/">Amujae</a>, an initiative launched this year by the Ellen Johnson Sirleaf Presidential Centre, encourages women to take up roles in the highest echelons of public leadership, and to bring other women along on the way. True democracy requires true representation.</p><p >Reliable public service cements trust between the government and the people, because when it works right, a professional and apolitical class of officials serves its country regardless of the administration in power. When the system works best, civil servants serve the people not the politicians. This is a daunting challenge, especially in an environment where faith in civil service has been lost among many. But I know it can be done.</p><p >__________________</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-3"></div></div></div><p ><em>Ellen Johnson Sirleaf is a former president of Liberia, serving from 2006 to 2018, and the founder and chair of the EJS Presidential Center for Women and Girls.
