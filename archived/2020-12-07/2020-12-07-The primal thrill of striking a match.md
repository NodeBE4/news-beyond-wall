It seems a good moment for candles. Which means, even better, it’s time for matches.</p><p >There’s no shortage of choice in the top kitchen drawer. Cook’s Matches, a hefty box with an efficient look. An equally big box of extra-long matches, to reach the oven pilot light if it blows out or to kindle anything successfully in the draughts that come through my windows. A little two-inch yellow box of Ship matches with a healthy rattle to it. Elegant, slim numbers from fancy restaurants and a few of the flimsy packs you can pick up in cafés like business cards.</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p >From this hoard anyone would think I was a smoker or at least had a fireplace to attend to. Not so. A button sparks the ignition for the gas. The restaurant matches are never used, nor are the flimsy ones, but – like the wire ties and short lengths of string with which they keep company – they have a useful air about them. The little Ship box is there for purely sentimental reasons, because as a child I found no better container for tiny treasures such as shells and beads. The very slide of the tray into the cover is satisfaction in itself. Those matches are now old and probably have no virtue left – not that it matters. They represent childhood in suspension. Potential delight.</p><p >Matches themselves, too, are all about potential. Even when dormant, they sizzle with the thought of fire. It is all there, safe and portable, a dream that the Chinese inevitably engineered first when they soaked pine splinters in sulphur a whole millennium ago.</p><blockquote><p>Matches represent childhood in suspension. Potential delight</p></blockquote><p >The slivers of wood have stayed the same, but the miraculous explosion now comes from that tiny bulb of potassium chlorate (mostly) and its quick, violent collision with the red phosphorus on the box. The matches lie ready for this fatal encounter in ordered ranks, like soldiers. I once found a specimen the size of a pin, too delicate to strike, and kept that too in token of what it might – still, just – be able to do.</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p >Though we can get all the heat and light we need by flicking a switch or turning a dial, somehow the primal urge to kindle remains with us. It is like making magic or invoking a god, as if we were still at the dawn of human existence. I’ve tried the ancient way, rubbing two sticks together; after what seemed like ages, they were still no more than warm. I’ve tried knocking flints too; there must be a trick to it, which I don’t have.</p><figure data-image-nozoom="true"><div itemscope="" itemProp="image" itemType="https://schema.org/ImageObject"><meta itemProp="url" content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/1236/90/1843magazine.com/sites/default/files/20201207_ST_Matchesx1280.jpg"/><img loading="lazy" width="1280" height="1236" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/1236/90/1843magazine.com/sites/default/files/20201207_ST_Matchesx1280.jpg"  sizes="(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw" alt=""/></div></figure><p >Even matches don’t always work at once, striking out dully, almost with a sigh. But at the next try they will catch, spark, shoot up with that sharp smell of chemicals and forests, ripple with yellow flame that deepens into orange and nestles in a growing, creeping cradle of blue. They will always produce, too, a point of danger: that moment when the flame flows towards my fingers and will burn down the place – unless with a fierce breath I blow it out.</p><p >A lighter would be easier. But these are soulless things. I am always vaguely disappointed to see altar candles lit with them, briskly, instead of the frisky play and taunting of matches fixed to a long pole, flaring disobediently or going out while the server flits from one candle to the next.</p><p >The moody character of matches – their sheer unpredictability – is part of their charm. They can burn reverently and still for a brief while; or they can be part of a drama, struck suddenly down some dark alley, half-lighting a face under a tipped fedora, glowing inside cupped hands.</p><blockquote><p>The moody character of matches – their sheer unpredictability – is part of their charm</p></blockquote><p >Black-and-white cinema, in particular, would be poorer without them. So would literature. Browning invoked them for a clandestine meeting of lovers at night on a wild coast: “A tap at the pane, the quick sharp scratch/And blue spurt of a lighted match”. It is as if the match itself is the sparking of hope and love itself. I always imagine them, too, striking and flickering in the first of T.S. Eliot’s “Preludes”:</p><p ><em>The winter evening settles down<br/> With smells of steak in passageways,<br/> Six o’clock.<br/> [...]<br/> And at the corner of the street<br/> A lonely cab-horse steams and stamps<br/> And then the lighting of the lamps.</em></p><p >From my own windows I can see lovely old double lanterns ranged along the promenade. Lamps, I suppose, could be lit in other ways even in the past, possibly from some central redoubt where an engineer pulls a lever or pushes a switch. But I like to picture a chap in a cap with a ladder and a large box of matches, making his slow rounds.</p><p >I now make my slow rounds too, striking each match, igniting each tea-light and dropping it into a glass. The matches find every quick gust of wind, play up and threaten my fingers as usual, but in the end they obey and retire, charred almost to their ends. My lease forbids the kindling of any “fire or flame” in my combustible old flat. But now I turn out the electric lights and sit among stars.<span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p><p >ILLUSTRATIONS:<strong>ANTONELLO SILVERINI</strong></p><br><hr><div>获取更多RSS：<br><a href="https://feedx.net" style="color:orange" target="_blank">https://feedx.net</a> <br><a href="https://feedx.xyz" style="color:orange" target="_blank">https://feedx.xyz</a><br></div>
