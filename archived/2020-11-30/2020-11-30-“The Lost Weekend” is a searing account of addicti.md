While on leave from a sanitorium in Davos, Switzerland, where he was being treated for tuberculosis, he noticed he was craving liquor even when hungover. His ambitions plagued him, too: he yearned to write but found the task slow-going. These and other woes have been poignantly documented by Blake Bailey, Jackson’s biographer. He describes the aspiring author as a “warmhearted, morbidly sensitive” fellow who was intermittently reliant on both booze and pills. By 1936 Jackson was drinking so much that he would sometimes wake up uncertain of which city he was in.</p><p >In 1942, during a lengthy interlude of sobriety, he began writing his debut novel, an autobiographical tale of addiction that was published in 1944. The protagonist of “The Lost Weekend” is Don Birnam, a 33-year-old New Yorker who begins a days-long “feast of drink” after failing to accompany his brother on a short holiday. The novel’s third-person narration takes in Birnam’s maudlin recollections, his musings on Shakespeare, his drunken attempt at stealing a handbag, his hungover effort at pawning a typewriter (Birnam, like his creator, is a stymied writer) and other intoxicated doings. Birnam injures himself and is taken to the “alcoholic ward”. As the story’s conclusion approaches, Birnam begins to battle with <em>delirium tremens</em>. </p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p >Though it was his first book, “The Lost Weekend” would remain the critical and commercial apex of Jackson’s career. Its appreciative readership not only included writers, critics, alcoholics and bibliophiles, but medical experts, too. A psychiatrist at Bellevue Hospital in New York thought “The Lost Weekend” showed “that fidelity to clinical fact is art”. An editor at the <em>Journal of the American Medical Association</em> saw in Jackson’s novel “the very soul of the dipsomaniac”. The director of the Rutgers Centre of Alcohol Studies vouched for its “profound influence on the field with which it deals”. Jackson himself once boasted that the novel was “the only work of fiction on the Required Reading list of the Yale Clinic” (an alcoholism treatment facility).</p><p >Billy Wilder’s adaptation of the novel was released 75 years ago, in November 1945. The film, starring Ray Milland as Birnam, was largely faithful to its source, with some notable exceptions. The novel alluded to Birnam’s sexuality in various ways, including his troubled memories of his affection for a fraternity member at his alma mater. (Jackson, who was bisexual, was again fictionalising his own experiences.) Since the film was subject to the Hays Code—industry guidelines which forbade depictions of homosexuality—it avoids the topic. </p><p >Yet audiences and critics responded positively to Wilder’s film: as well as winning four Academy Awards, it was the eighth-highest-grossing movie that year. According to Mr Bailey, Wilder expected the film to “be a pioneering work: that is, a movie that didn’t milk the subject [of alcoholism] for laughs.” That description certainly fits: in 2011, when the United States Library of Congress selected “The Lost Weekend” for preservation in the National Film Registry, they praised it as an “uncompromising look at the devastating effects of alcoholism”. </p><p >It is hard to forget the whites of Milland’s eyes, seen in extreme close-up as Birnam awakes from soused slumber, or the image of Milland trundling down the street, a sullen and reedy figure in a stolen overcoat. These and other images are credible evocations of despair, even 75 years on. The film’s impact can also be discerned in the American television series “Mad Men”, the storylines of which occasionally allude to Wilder’s film, as when protagonist and inebriate Don Draper embarks on his own lost weekend in the fourth season. Matthew Weiner, the showrunner, seemed to confirm the influence by hosting a screening of Wilder’s film in 2015. </p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p >In a revision Jackson disliked, Wilder’s film concluded with Birnam suddenly embracing sobriety. The ending of the novel portended more drinking and protected the integrity of the story—which was about being in the throes of alcoholism—by suggesting that recovery was possible but it was not guaranteed. Alcoholism “was something that would ail you always, as long as you lasted (and how long would that be, the way you were going?)” Birnam reflects. “But—you did have this: you could recover and stay well.” </p><p >Sadly, recovery and health largely eluded Jackson. He enjoyed bursts of creativity after “The Lost Weekend” but also sought out vast quantities of alcohol, pills and paraldehyde. He died in 1968 after an overdose of barbiturates, yet something of his tumultuous life is preserved in his affecting debut novel.</p>
