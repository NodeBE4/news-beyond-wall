It was a golden age for radically minded soul music, with a great deal to be passionate about. If the intervening years had gone as they should have done, that music’s resonance might be purely historical. Yet five decades on, the Staples’ songs calling for equality and justice for black Americans chime with the Black Lives Matter movement. The moral arc of the universe is, it seems, taking even longer to bend towards justice than Martin Luther King might have hoped.</p><p >The Staples were the outstanding pop-gospel outfit of their time, or any other. They were musical giants as well as a formidable political and social force: their music was the point at which the civil-rights movement and the counterculture of the 1960s met. Roebuck “Pops” Staples, the group’s founder, was a close friend of King’s; his daughter Mavis, of Bob Dylan, who once asked for her hand in marriage.</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p >Ms Staples, now 81, has enjoyed a career resurgence in the 21st century, reminding audiences of what an extraordinary singer she is. She has not only kept alive her own creative flame, but ensured the memory of her former band remains vivid. A box set, “Come Go With Me: The Stax Collection”, issued on CD this month after a vinyl and digital release last year, shows them at the pinnacle of their powers and emphasises how inspiring their music could be.</p><p >The Staple Singers were a family affair. The youngest of 14 children, “Pops” Staples was born in 1914 on a cotton plantation in Mississippi. In the 1940s he and his wife Oceola enlisted their young children to form a gospel ensemble. This was the beginning of a path, from the congregation to the concert hall, that many black performers would follow. Sam Cooke was its trailblazer, and many devout adherents of gospel never forgave him for secularising what they felt should remain purely sacred music. The Staples, whether through conviction or canniness, did not fully cross over from one to the other, but by the 1960s they had certainly crossed over into the charts: their nickname was “God’s Greatest Hitmakers”.</p><p >In 1965 the Staples signed to Epic records, an offshoot of the venerable Columbia label, which specialised in promoting talent from popular music’s left field. Over three years they would release seven albums, a mixture of spirituals, gospel, traditional standards, R’n’B and covers of recent pop hits largely drawn from the burgeoning and highly commercial folk-pop scene. But, as with fellow gospel-based act Aretha Franklin, who was signed to Columbia, it would take a move to a more individualistic label with a distinctive ethos and sound to bring them into their own. Just as Franklin, upon signing to Atlantic, blossomed into “the Queen of Soul”, so the Staples truly flourished when they joined Stax, with its outstanding roster of writers, producers and session players.</p><p >If Motown was, as it styled itself, “The Sound of Young America”, then Stax claimed to be the sound of black America. Motown was Northern, metropolitan, polished, urbane, taking on white pop at its own game and winning with panache. Stax was Southern, raw, gritty and eager under its new co-owner, Al Bell, to push a strong sense of black consciousness. It was the perfect home for the Staples, who were ready to toughen up both their sound and their message. Their first two Stax albums, “Soul Folk in Action” (1968) and “We’ll Get Over” (1970) were exciting and inventive, showcasing their talent both for overt protest and for drawing out subtext from seemingly innocuous pop tunes, such as “A Wednesday In Your Garden” by the Guess Who, which they transformed from lovelorn baroque pop into a critique of black social exclusion. </p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p >Yet those records didn’t sell, so Mr Bell stepped in and took charge as producer. The three LPs that followed would define the Staple Singers and prove the foundation of their legacy. The group peaked, both artistically and commercially, with the second of these, “Be Altitude: Respect Yourself” (1972). It not only contained two of their best loved hits, “Respect Yourself” and “I’ll Take You There”, but coalesced their sound into a glorious blend of supple, funky R’n’B and gospel vocals, by turns brooding, uplifting and smokily sensuous. Today it stands with the very best of that era’s magnificent soul music.</p><p >The Staples’ stint at Stax ended when the label collapsed into bankruptcy at the end of 1975. They went on to enjoy a final commercial flourish, topping the <em>Billboard</em> chart with “Let’s Do It Again”, the title song written by Curtis Mayfield for Sidney Poitier’s hit comedy film. Although they recorded together until the mid-1980s, they would never again approach those heights. No matter; they had already, in those Stax years, been to the top of the mountain.</p>
