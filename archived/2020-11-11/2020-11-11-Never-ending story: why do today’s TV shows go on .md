And though the span of life is a little longer for most of us now than it was in Roman times, the entertainment industry seems determined to stuff our additional life years with long films, interminable Netflix series and endless podcasts.</p><p >We often talk about being time poor, but that’s because contemporary artists devour so much of it. Martin Scorsese’s “The Irishman” was three-and-a-half hours long. “Game of Thrones” stretched to 60 episodes – and four of the final six lasted more than 75 minutes each. Netflix recently celebrated the wonders of Marvel’s superheroes in a succession of 13-episode series.</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p >The bright side of supersizing is the chance for full immersion. Leo Tolstoy’s “War and Peace” is a compelling novel, as well as a great one, because it takes time to tell a story on a vast canvas. Why shouldn’t today’s <small>TV</small> and film directors do the same? “The Wire” and “The Sopranos” are compulsive viewing precisely because their creators have time to explore characters and their worlds in depth. “Game of Thrones” was sensational at creating an alternate universe populated by a mesmerising cast.</p><p >The promise of losing yourself in another existence is particularly attractive during a pandemic. Netflix and Amazon Prime – and yes, even the <small>BBC</small> and <small>HBO</small> – provide us with all sorts of wonderful benefits during lockdown. This digital world offers a substitute to the social life of pubs, restaurants and cafés; a respite from the pressure of tele-commuting (rather than gabbing on Zoom you can simply lie back and watch the flickering figures); and an introduction to a realm where the threat of covid-19 is absent, or at least pales into insignificance compared with the threat of being roasted by a dragon or murdered by the Mafia.</p><blockquote><p>A whole episode is taken up with one character ambling around an oh-so-big American supermarket</p></blockquote><p >These assets are all the more important as the nights draw in and temperatures fall. Yet the more I’ve stared at the <small>TV</small> screen during these covid-tinged months, the more frustrated I’ve become: rather than immersion I’ve been meandering; instead of entertainment I’ve been given self-indulgence. Even the most talented auteurs have taken to banging on too long.</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p >Did Quentin Tarantino’s “Kill Bill” really need two parts or “Once Upon a Time in Hollywood” that extra hour? “Game of Thrones” stumbled as it hit the last series and struggled to fill the expanding time. “Breaking Bad”, one of the great shows of recent years, threw away an entire episode fixating on the buzzing of a fly.</p><figure data-image-nozoom="true"><div itemscope="" itemProp="image" itemType="https://schema.org/ImageObject"><meta itemProp="url" content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/1218/90/1843magazine.com/sites/default/files/HWLNToolongx1280.jpg"/><img loading="lazy" width="1280" height="1218" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/1218/90/1843magazine.com/sites/default/files/HWLNToolongx1280.jpg"  sizes="(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw" alt=""/></div></figure><p >When it comes to more run-of-the-mill talents, the fashion for supersizing is not so much an encumbrance as a disaster. Directors have taken to filling the available time with the equivalent of hot air – plots that wander, minor characters who pop up for no reason, filler walks by the sea or conversations about the meaning of life. “The Americans”, a series about Russian spies in America who pass themselves off as regular citizens, seems to drag on for longer than the cold war itself. A whole episode is taken up with one character, Oleg, ambling around an oh-so-big American supermarket.</p><p >The fashion for space-filling is driven by the collusion of technology and artistic ego. In the old world <small>TV</small> programmes had to be divided into neat slices to be sandwiched between adverts: half an hour for comedies and an hour for dramas or documentaries. Powerful studio heads and <small>TV</small> bosses forced writers to master the art of efficient storytelling – in order to keep the audience watching (they needed to get them from one lot of bill-paying ads to the next). In the new world artists are unshackled from such constraints. Digital space is seemingly limitless, and the various competing “platforms” are desperate for content.</p><p >Opportunism has also played a role. In a world in which eyeballs are currency, studio heads can’t bear to sacrifice them once they’ve been captured. So even successful series chug along long after they’ve run out of creative steam. “Narcos” was gripping at first, but as the episodes rolled the editing became sloppier and the story line repetitive. I suspect that the already fading “Crown” – season four is due to hit screens on November 15th – will overdo the wedding pageantry with interminable preparations and lingering shots of Diana’s gown.</p><p >It’s time for change. Some of the most successful shows of recent years have also been the most disciplined: “Little Fires Everywhere” managed to combine the pace of the old dispensation with the expansiveness of the new, and ran for only eight episodes. “Unorthodox” was shockingly short (and brilliant), with four parts.</p><p >Today’s equivalent of studio heads are beginning to realise that people are tired of having their time taken for granted: Netflix has even introduced a feature that allows you to play its stuff at double speed. Reed Hastings, Netflix’s boss, once described old-fashioned television as “managed dissatisfaction”, because you had to wait a week for the next episode. He and his ilk are in danger of replacing managed dissatisfaction with “unmanaged dissatisfaction”. There’s just one thing standing in their way: we may all die of boredom first, still trying to make it to the end of a new thousand-part series.<span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p><p >ILLUSTRATIONS: <strong>EWELINA KARPOWIAK</strong></p>
