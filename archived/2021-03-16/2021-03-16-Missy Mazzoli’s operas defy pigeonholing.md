Many cherished heroines of the lyric stage have a thankless time, from Purcell’s Dido to Puccini’s Madama Butterfly and Berg’s Lulu. Given that the repertoire is already over-loaded with doomed leading ladies, it was a surprise to many when, in 2016, one of the most gifted young women in American music chose as the basis for her third opera a gruelling film about an apparently submissive and victimised wife: Lars von Trier’s “Breaking the Waves” (1996).</p><p >Working with her regular librettist, Royce Vavrek, Missy Mazzoli (pictured) chose to adapt a bleakly shocking plot about a married heroine who takes other lovers. The character does so not to pursue personal freedom but as an act of devotion to the will of her paralysed husband, injured in an oil-rig accident. He urges her not to fidelity, but promiscuity, as a way to seal their love. In the story of Bess McNeill and Jan Nyman, set on a storm-swept Scottish island, the theme of female self-sacrifice takes on a bizarre, unsettling shape. </p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p >Ms Mazzoli found in Bess’s ordeal a tale of fulfilment rather than abjection. Bess defies every dogma of her tight-knot Calvinist community to affirm her transgressive version of loyalty and love. “Everyone around her is telling her what to do and how to act,” Ms Mazzoli has said. “They’re punishing her for falling off the line of acceptable behaviour, which in reality is impossibly thin.” Her opera, with its soaring lyricism offset by oceanic swells and squalls of sound, won plaudits and awards when it had its premiere at Philadelphia Opera in 2016. Further accolades came when the Edinburgh International Festival re-staged it in 2019. From March 19th until April 12th it will reach its widest audience yet in an online production streamed by LA Opera in Los Angeles. </p><p >Ms Mazzoli’s operatic works have foregrounded women who doubt or flout social norms, and clash with communal authority. In 2012 “Song from the Uproar” staged the scandalous adventures of Isabelle Eberhardt, a Swiss explorer. After “Breaking the Waves”, Ms Mazzoli and Mr Vavrek wrote “Proving Up” (2018), in which a pioneer clan in Nebraska in the 1860s tests the limits of the American Dream. Had the pandemic not intervened, the world premiere of their next collaboration, “The Listeners”, would have been held in Oslo this month. It follows a suburban teacher in the American south-west as she joins a charismatic cult.</p><p >In Ms Mazzoli’s own childhood community, a small town in Pennsylvania, the profession of classical composer felt like an outlandish dream. She devoured all sorts of music, learned piano from an early age, studied at Boston University and Yale School of Music, and later held composer-in-residence posts in Philadelphia and Chicago. She is currently attached to the Mannes School of Music in New York and plays with her own (all-female) ensemble, Victoire. Although influenced early on by the hypnotic minimalism of composers such as Steve Reich and Terry Riley, she has cultivated an eclectic musical palette, as often lush as spare, and explored far-reaching tastes. The moody seascapes of “Breaking the Waves” may bring Benjamin Britten’s opera “Peter Grimes” to mind, but elsewhere she adroitly uses electronica techniques such as sampling. Like her peers on the classical scene—she was born in 1980—Ms Mazzoli glides easily between genres.</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p >Her large-scale orchestral pieces, such as “Sinfonia (for Orbiting Spheres)”, can weave mesmeric soundscapes that merit comparison to Holst or Messiaen. And she fits her instrumentation to her theme: “Proving Up”, with its hardscrabble Midwest setting, features eight jangling guitars. In a recent interview, she reported that she was listening to Senegalese music and “Kate Bush, always”. </p><p >Even in the 21st century few women composers are widely heard. American data for 2019-2020, compiled by the Women’s Philharmonic Advocacy group, indicate that works by women amounted to 6.5% of all classical performances. For the same season, the Donne: Women in Music foundation surveyed 15 top-rated global orchestras. Only 3.6% of the works they scheduled were by women. </p><p >Ms Mazzoli herself has seen her music showcased at the BBC Proms and commissioned by the Metropolitan Opera in New York, for which she and Mr Vavrek will write an opera inspired by George Saunders’s Booker-prizewinning novel “Lincoln in the Bardo”. That made her, with Jeanine Tesori, one of the first two women to receive a main-stage commission from the Met in its 137-year history. Aware that she’s still a high-profile rarity, in 2016 Ms Mazzoli launched a mentoring scheme, Luna Lab, for aspiring female composers aged 13 to 19. </p><p >Yet opera’s heroines continue to suffer, cry and die: not even Ms Mazzoli’s Bess can dodge her destiny. Her creator, though, enlists the power of music to enrich and complicate the tragic plot. Opera, for Ms Mazzoli, is a place where beautiful contradictions can thrive. </p><p ><em>“Breaking the Waves” will be streaming between March 19th and April 12th via <a href="https://www.economist.comhttps://www.laopera.org/performances/upcoming-digital-performances/breaking-the-waves-3/">laopera.org</a></em></p>
