Official tallies reckon that it has caused <span data-interactive-></span> infections and led to the deaths of <span data-interactive-></span> people. The true toll <a href="https://www.economist.comhttps://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/coronavirus-excess-deaths-tracker"> may be higher still</a>. Vaccines to combat <small>SARS-C</small>o<small>V-2</small>, the virus that causes the disease, have been developed in record time. So far <span data-interactive-></span> countries have mass-vaccination programmes underway and together they have administered about <span data-interactive-></span> jabs. Our global covid-19 data tracker is updated twice a day with the latest figures. </p><p ><iframe height="NaN" src="https://www.economist.com/assets/infographic/2021/latest-updates/index.html?text=covid-19-latest-updates&amp;time=false"></iframe></p><h2 data-interactive->Vaccination</h2><p > Since the first inoculation in Britain on December 8th, mass-vaccination programmes are now active in every continent of the world. Still, <span data-interactive-></span> countries have not begun vaccinating, mostly in sub-Saharan Africa. So far <span data-interactive-></span> of the world&#x27;s adults have received one dose of a covid-19 vaccine. Vaccines for children are yet to be approved. </p><p ><iframe height="NaN" src="https://www.economist.com/assets/infographic/2021/covid-19-vaccines-table/table-world.html"></iframe></p><hr/><h2 data-interactive->Doses ordered by country</h2><p > In total, countries have ordered about <span data-interactive-></span> vaccine doses from manufacturers to be delivered during 2021 (including vaccines not yet approved for use) according to a tally by Airfinity, a life-sciences data company. Although some manufacturers may face delays, that would mean there would be enough for <span data-interactive-></span> shots for each of the world&#x27;s 5.2bn adults. However, these doses are not shared equally. <span data-interactive-></span> has signed contracts for enough jabs to give every adult <span data-interactive-></span> doses each, whereas <span data-interactive-></span> countries are expecting to receive just <span data-interactive-></span> doses per adult, on average. </p><figure><iframe height="NaN" src="https://www.economist.com/assets/infographic/2021/vaccine-tracker/vaccine-map.html" data-size="full-width"></iframe></figure><hr/><h2 data-interactive-> Doses by vaccine manufacturer and recipient</h2><p > Many of the vaccines for poor and lower-middle income countries come from an international programme called <small>COVAX</small>. It plans to distribute as many as <span data-interactive-></span> doses to 91 countries this year that would otherwise struggle to have secured them. The Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine is the most widely-ordered vaccine. It has promised <span data-interactive-></span> doses to <span data-interactive-></span> different countries and organisations this year but has faced production delays. So far <span data-interactive-></span> vaccines producing a total of <span data-interactive-></span> doses have received regulatory approval for use in the countries for which they have been ordered. </p><p ><iframe height="NaN" src="https://www.economist.com/assets/infographic/2021/vaccine-tracker/vaccine-orders.html"></iframe></p><hr/><h2 data-interactive->First doses administered by country</h2><p > A total of <span data-interactive-></span> countries have given first doses to over 50% of their adults. <span data-interactive-></span> leads the way to herd immunity, having given first doses to <span data-interactive-></span> of adults. </p><figure><iframe height="NaN" src="https://www.economist.com/assets/infographic/2021/vaccine-tracker/vaccine-trend.html" data-size="full-width"></iframe></figure><h2 data-interactive->Doses administered by country</h2><p ><iframe height="NaN" src="https://www.economist.com/assets/infographic/2021/covid-19-vaccines-table/table-countries.html"></iframe></p><h2 data-interactive->Cases and deaths</h2><h2 data-interactive->Confirmed cases by region</h2><p > It is estimated that perhaps three-quarters of people infected with <small>SARS-C</small>o<small>V-2</small> show no symptoms. The quality of testing regimes varies enormously across the world. Tanzania has not reported a single case since May 2020 simply because it has not tested anyone. That makes it tricky to compare the number of cases across countries. Nonetheless the trends can be informative. Cases have been rising fastest over the past seven days in <span data-interactive-></span>. </p><figure><iframe height="NaN" src="https://www.economist.com/assets/infographic/2021/covid-19-world-tracker/time-series-region-cases.html" data-size="full-width"></iframe></figure><h2 data-interactive->Confirmed deaths by region</h2><p > Cases can be hidden from view, but deaths are easier to detect even though reporting standards do vary, too. Fully <span data-interactive-></span> of the total global deaths from covid-19 have taken place in <span data-interactive-></span>. Deaths over the past seven days are currently highest in <span data-interactive-></span> although they are rising fastest in <span data-interactive-></span>. </p><figure><iframe height="NaN" src="https://www.economist.com/assets/infographic/2021/covid-19-world-tracker/time-series-region.html" data-size="full-width"></iframe></figure><hr/><h2 data-interactive->Confirmed cases and deaths by country</h2><p ><iframe height="NaN" src="https://www.economist.com/assets/infographic/2021/covid-19-world-tracker/table.html"></iframe></p><figure data-interactive-><iframe height="NaN" src="https://www.economist.com/assets/infographic/2021/dynamic-text-inserter/index.html?key=key_name&amp;csvPath=2020/covid19-tracker/data/dynamic-text-values.csv"></iframe></figure><p data-interactive- > Sources: Airfinity; Johns Hopkins University, CSSE; Our World In Data; United Nations; <i>The Economist</i></p><p ><br/></p><p ><em> To stay up to speed with The Economist’s latest coverage of the pandemic, visit our coronavirus <a href="https://www.economist.com/coronavirus-pandemic">hub</a>; listen to <a href="https://www.economist.com/podcasts/the-jab-a-new-podcast-from-the-economist">The Jab</a>, our podcast on the race between injections and infections; <a href="https://www.economist.comhttps://my.economist.com/user#newsletter">register</a> to receive our weekly newsletter, which has a special edition showcasing our coronavirus coverage; and follow our other data trackers showing <a href="https://www.economist.comhttps://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/coronavirus-excess-deaths-tracker">excess deaths by country</a> and the virus’s spread across <a href="https://www.economist.comhttps://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/tracking-coronavirus-across-europe">Europe</a> and <a href="https://www.economist.comhttps://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/tracking-coronavirus-across-america">America</a>. </em></p><figure data-infographic-js="1"></figure>
