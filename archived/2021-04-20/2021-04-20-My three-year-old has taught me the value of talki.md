I’m no misanthrope, yet my nearly three-year-old daughter’s intense attraction towards – and curiosity about – her fellow human beings is a source of ongoing wonder. She has always been a lively and loquacious child, even by toddler standards. It wasn’t until last summer, in that long early stretch of the pandemic, that the extent of her gregariousness first became obvious.</p><p >This was peak ice-cream-eating season, and after dinner it became her custom to wander over to the freezer and take out a mini Cornetto, which she would insist on eating in our tiny front garden. “Out front,” she would say, pointing in imperious toddler style towards the door and the world beyond.</p><p >We would sit on the bench in front of our house and while away 20 minutes eating our ice creams. But my daughter’s real desire was to stand at the gate and say “hello” to anyone who passed by. We live in a densely populated part of Dublin’s inner city, so this led to a lot of chit-chat with a varied cross-section of people: young couples out for a walk, families getting in and out of cars with buggies and shopping bags, and elaborately courteous heroin addicts on their way back from scoring down the street.</p><blockquote><p>This led to a lot of chit-chat with elaborately courteous heroin addicts on their way back from scoring down the street</p></blockquote><p >This was all fairly charming, and I was reassured by my daughter’s natural sociability and solid adjustment to locked-down toddlerhood. But in recent months it’s all got out of hand. Her gregariousness has taken on a somewhat hysterical aspect. She is like a political candidate in the last desperate days of a campaign, bearing down on unsuspecting strangers with outstretched arms and empty blandishments.</p><figure data-image-nozoom="true"><div itemscope="" itemProp="image" itemType="https://schema.org/ImageObject"><meta itemProp="url" content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/1280/90/1843magazine.com/sites/default/files/1843_20210420_CT-CHATTYKIDS_002.jpg"/><img loading="lazy" width="1280" height="1280" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/1280/90/1843magazine.com/sites/default/files/1843_20210420_CT-CHATTYKIDS_002.jpg"  sizes="(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw" alt=""/></div></figure><p >We don’t have much of a garden, so the pandemic has compelled us to go to the park every day, often twice, to get the kids out of the house. We’re lucky to have good parks within easy walking distance, but my wife and I are sick of going to them all the time. And a big part of this is our daughter’s insistence on talking to every human she encounters.</p><blockquote><p>She is like a political candidate in the last desperate days of a campaign, bearing down on unsuspecting strangers</p></blockquote><p >She’ll take what she can get, but she tends to be drawn more towards groups than individuals (in this too, she resembles a campaigning politician). Sometimes she’ll sidle up to a couple sitting on a bench and wait it out until they say something to her, then take it from there. More often, though, she’ll employ a direct approach. Her preferred method, in recent weeks, has been to stride up to people, point at their faces and say “Who’s your name?”</p><figure data-image-nozoom="true"><div itemscope="" itemProp="image" itemType="https://schema.org/ImageObject"><meta itemProp="url" content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/1280/90/1843magazine.com/sites/default/files/1843_20210420_CT-CHATTYKIDS_003.jpg"/><img loading="lazy" width="1280" height="1280" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/1280/90/1843magazine.com/sites/default/files/1843_20210420_CT-CHATTYKIDS_003.jpg"  sizes="(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw" alt=""/></div></figure><p >The problem for me is that, when she is foisting herself on unsuspecting strangers in this way, I can’t just stand and gaze into the middle distance or scroll through Instagram. (Strictly speaking, I suppose I could do both these things, but that might come across as rude.) I’m not anti-social or particularly shy. But I’m also not wild about being thrust into uneasily polite conversation with complete strangers as a condition of leaving the house. Going to the park with my daughter has become a form of speed-dating in which the aim is to make as many casual acquaintances as possible as quickly as possible.</p><blockquote><p>Her preferred method has been to stride up to people, point at their faces, and say “Who’s your name?”</p></blockquote><p >The puppy we got three months ago has escalated the situation. It’s extremely cute, even by puppy standards, and it is now impossible to get much farther than our front gate without having to stop and chat to someone – either because they want to greet the dog, or because they have dogs with them who wish to get acquainted with ours.</p><p >Dogs, with their practice of sniffing each other, are even more effective than young children at forcing you into social interactions with other people. I have come to view bottom-sniffing as an oddly formal, even genteel exchange, like swapping business cards. Here again, I sense it would be a bit off just to stand and look at my phone.</p><figure data-image-nozoom="true"><div itemscope="" itemProp="image" itemType="https://schema.org/ImageObject"><meta itemProp="url" content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/1280/90/1843magazine.com/sites/default/files/1843_20210420_CT-CHATTYKIDS_004.jpg"/><img loading="lazy" width="1280" height="1280" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/1280/90/1843magazine.com/sites/default/files/1843_20210420_CT-CHATTYKIDS_004.jpg"  sizes="(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw" alt=""/></div></figure><p >My daughter has ruthlessly exploited the puppy’s natural charisma to further her own social agenda. She insists on holding the lead when we’re in the park. As soon as she spots anyone who seems to be interested in the puppy or even just looks at her, she walks up to them and says “This is my puppy. Her name is Ally.” It’s crude but extremely effective.</p><p data-caps="initial" ><span data-caps="initial">I</span>n many ways my daughter’s sociability is a good thing. I love her fearlessness and her interest in sharing her tiny world with others, thereby enlarging it. It’s probably a good thing for me, too. Even though, at any given moment, I would prefer not to start chatting to a random stranger – just as, presumably, they would prefer not to have to chat to me – it’s usually interesting and enriching, even in small and ephemeral ways. The discomfort has been salutary since it has made me see the narrowness and rigidity of my supposedly adult attitude to other people. Parenthood is largely the experience of being driven, repeatedly, remorselessly and in an ever-expanding number of ways, out of your comfort zone.</p><blockquote><p>Parenthood the experience of being repeatedly and remorselessly driven out of your comfort zone</p></blockquote><p >Last weekend, at the end of our second park visit of the day, my daughter and I were just about to head home when we encountered a woman with a puppy about the age and size of our own. After the usual exchange of business cards, the dogs got into some intense acrobatic frolicking, and the woman and I started to chat about this and that: our experience of puppy ownership, the lack of on-street parking, life in a mildly dystopian society ruled over by the bewildering dynamics of a pandemic, the usual small talk.</p><p >As we were talking, my daughter began to pluck handfuls of daisies from the grass and hand them to each of us in turn, then directed us to put the daisies in our hair. If the woman hadn’t obliged immediately, I’m not sure I would have done my daughter’s bidding. But she did, and I followed her lead, not wanting to seem like the sort of father who crushes his child’s spontaneity and whimsy.</p><p >There we were, this stranger and I, threading flowers into our hair, one after the other, until our heads were wreathed with plucked daisies. It occurred to me, as I accepted yet another bloom from my daughter, and suggested that she might want to leave some for the other people in the park, that I didn’t feel remotely awkward. My comfort zone was larger than the last time I had tested its borders.<span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p><p ><strong>Mark O’Connell</strong> is <em>1843</em>’s parenting columnist and the author of “Notes from an Apocalypse”</p><p >ILLUSTRATIONS: <strong>KLAUS KREMMERZ</strong></p><br><hr><div>获取更多RSS：<br><a href="https://feedx.net" style="color:orange" target="_blank">https://feedx.net</a> <br><a href="https://feedx.top" style="color:orange" target="_blank">https://feedx.top</a><br></div>
