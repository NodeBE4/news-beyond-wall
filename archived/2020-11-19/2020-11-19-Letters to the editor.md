He has taken back the blue-wall states of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. He also won the national popular vote, probably by a margin of five percentage points. All this while running against an incumbent president and all the advantages that conveys, and the substantial bias towards Republicans in the electoral college.</p><p >The narrative that this was a close election is a false one (“<a href="https://www.economist.com/leaders/2020/11/05/what-the-2020-results-say-about-americas-future">When every vote counts</a>”, November 7th). It arose from the order in which votes were counted—Florida was an early win for Donald Trump—and the inevitable delays in counting record numbers of postal ballots, most of which came from Democrats. True, it was not the landslide predicted by many pollsters, who have clearly failed in consecutive election cycles, but it is an enormous victory for Mr Biden and the coalition he has built, and a repudiation of Mr Trump.</p><p ><small>EAMON GLACKIN</small><br/><em>New York</em></p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p >Many of us who voted for Mr Trump in 2016 did so reluctantly. Not so in 2020. The further drift to the left of the Democrats was part of it, with their idiotic identity politics. But then so was the Russia-hoax investigation, the ridiculous impeachment proceedings and the unfathomable hatred spewed towards our president. We saw President Trump as someone who got things done, using a wrecking ball when dealing with stagnant bureaucracies. We saw the Iran deal as appeasement, the Paris accord as wealth redistribution doing little to tackle climate issues, the relocation of our embassy to Jerusalem as a law at last implemented, and pushing our European partners to pay their fair share for their own defence as long overdue.</p><p >We saw many more accomplishments during his tenure, where you and others saw nothing good. This election was close. That is because the Democrats never came to terms with Mr Trump’s victory in 2016. They would have done better if they had tried to understand why they lost then and changed direction.</p><p ><small>RUTH BERNER</small><br/><em>Swannanoa, North Carolina</em></p><p >Much of the media’s coverage of the election focused on how divided the country is, but Americans are not as polarised as they may appear. Most voted pragmatically, to remove the inept Mr Trump, and ensure that Mr Biden, or perhaps more accurately, his left flank, lacks a clear path to pass a sweeping liberal agenda in Congress. This election had a high turnout, upwards of 155m people. Most of those votes did not come from the fringe, they came from the centre.</p><p ><small>THOMAS EASTMAN</small><br/><em>Minneapolis</em></p><p >In 1878 William Gladstone declared that the American constitution “is the most wonderful work ever struck off at a given time by the brain and purpose of man.” I find it puzzling that you refer to this wonderful work as “rickety” (“<a href="https://www.economist.com/united-states/2020/11/05/democrats-dreams-for-congress-go-up-in-smoke">Spell unbroken</a>”, November 7th). Divided government has served the United States well and yielded prosperity. Think of the eras of Ronald Reagan and Tip O’Neill, Bill Clinton and Newt Gingrich, Barack Obama and Mitch McConnell.</p><p ><small>ART HOTZ</small><br/><em>New York</em></p><figure><div itemscope="" itemProp="image" itemType="https://schema.org/ImageObject" data-slim="0"><meta itemProp="url" content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/720/90/sites/default/files/20201107_USP509.jpg"/><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/720/90/sites/default/files/20201107_USP509.jpg"  sizes="(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw" alt=""/></div></figure><p >I am, I hope, a reasonably sophisticated reader of opinion polls, and chaired the House of Lords select committee on the subject, which reported in 2018. No doubt the American Association for Public Opinion Research will do the thorough job of investigating this miss as they did after Hillary Clinton’s defeat, just as Professor Patrick Sturgis and his team did after the British polls got the election in 2015 so wrong. Like you (“<a href="https://www.economist.com/united-states/2020/11/05/polls-and-our-forecast-model-overestimated-support-for-joe-biden">Whiffing twice</a>”, November 7th) I think the most likely explanation is that the voters who refused to reply to pollsters—11 in 12 according to some estimates—are not typical of voters as a whole. That proportion of refuseniks has grown, and is growing.</p><p >Opinion polls have their uses, particularly on social matters when small differences in the precise numbers don’t matter. In elections however, small differences can matter very much indeed. A tool is not a good tool if it is used for a purpose, in this case forecasting election results, for which it is not really fit.</p><p ><small>DAVID LIPSEY</small><br/>House of Lords<br/><em>London</em></p><h2>The attempted coup in Turkey</h2><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-3"></div></div></div><figure><div itemscope="" itemProp="image" itemType="https://schema.org/ImageObject" data-slim="0"><meta itemProp="url" content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/720/90/sites/default/files/20201107_LDP001.jpg"/><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/720/90/sites/default/files/20201107_LDP001.jpg"  sizes="(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw" alt=""/></div></figure><p >“<a href="https://www.economist.com/leaders/2020/11/05/france-is-right-to-defend-free-speech">Voltaire’s heirs</a>” (November 7th) stated that thousands of Muslims in Turkey were locked up “for belonging to the wrong religious group”. That is incorrect. The people in question were jailed for trying to stage a military coup in Turkey in July 2016 that caused the loss of life of more than 250 people while bombing cities, and the Turkish Parliament, with fighter jets. Describing them as the “wrong religious group” does nothing to contribute towards protecting the freedoms of speech and belief.</p><p ><small>UMIT YALCIN</small><br/>Ambassador for Turkey<br/><em>London</em></p><figure><div itemscope="" itemProp="image" itemType="https://schema.org/ImageObject" data-slim="0"><meta itemProp="url" content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/720/90/sites/default/files/20201017_FBD001_0.jpg"/><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/720/90/sites/default/files/20201017_FBD001_0.jpg"  sizes="(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw" alt=""/></div></figure><h2>Thailand’s politics</h2><p >When reporting on Thailand’s monarchy the media should avoid cherry-picking anecdotes to fit certain narratives (“<a href="https://www.economist.com/briefing/2020/10/14/thailands-king-seeks-to-bring-back-absolute-monarchy">Battle royal</a>”, October 17th). The Crown Property Bureau has dedicated large sums of investment for public benefits. King Maha Vajiralongkorn has asked the <small>CPB</small> to consider using its land for constructing water reservoirs to solve a water scarcity problem. Siam Bioscience, an investment of the <small>CPB</small> to improve patients’ access to high quality medicine, is co-operating with AstraZeneca to develop a covid-19 vaccine for Thailand and South-East Asia.</p><p >Although the monarchy is regarded in high esteem, it has often been inappropriately politicised by opposing factions, particularly when tension arises. The recent protests and suggestions for political reform reflect the reality of the conflict between people of different viewpoints in our society, which has been exacerbated by the increase of hate speech circulated both in mainstream and social media. As such, structural changes can only be achieved through open dialogue and not further divisiveness and violence.</p><p ><small>PISANU SUVANAJATA</small><br/>Ambassador for Thailand<br/><em>London</em></p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-4"></div></div></div><h2>The provenance of a proverb</h2><p >The phrase, “like two bald men fighting over a comb”, has a longer history than the border skirmish in 1998 between Ethiopia and Eritrea (“<a href="https://www.economist.com/leaders/2020/11/07/ethiopias-prime-minister-may-be-starting-a-civil-war">Ethiopia is poised to unravel</a>”, November 7th). It is often quoted as if it is a new witticism. In fact, Jorge Luis Borges used it in reference to the Falklands war in 1982, and it stretches back further in time than that, possibly all the way to Phaedrus, a writer in ancient Rome. Borges, however, may have been the first to use it as a metaphor for futile war.</p><p ><small>CHRIS CHAPMAN</small><br/><em>London</em></p><figure><div itemscope="" itemProp="image" itemType="https://schema.org/ImageObject" data-slim="0"><meta itemProp="url" content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/720/90/sites/default/files/20201024_CND000.jpg"/><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/720/90/sites/default/files/20201024_CND000.jpg"  sizes="(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw" alt=""/></div></figure><h2>No wish to return</h2><p ><a href="https://www.economist.com/china/2020/10/22/chinas-half-loving-half-threatening-pitch-to-taiwan-doesnt-work">Chaguan’s </a>column (October 24th) on China’s double-edged message to Taiwan of “Come home, or China will kill you” reminded me of “Hamilton”.
