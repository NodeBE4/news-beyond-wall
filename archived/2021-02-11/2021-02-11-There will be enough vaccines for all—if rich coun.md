In the two months since mass vaccination began, at least 148m doses have been administered—more than the number of people who have ever tested positive for the disease. A further 39m are now getting a jab every week.</p><p >The new vaccines have been designed and tested with unprecedented speed. According to a tally kept by Airfinity, an analytics company, 378 covid-19 vaccines are in various stages of development. Of those, three (made by Pfizer, Moderna and AstraZeneca) have met the stringent rules for regulatory approval in at least one Western country; two more (made by Novavax and Johnson &amp; Johnson) should get the green light soon. Two vaccines from China and a promising Russian one have also been authorised in some countries.</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-1"></div></div></div><figure  data-infographic-></figure><figure><iframe height="NaN" src="https://infographics.economist.com/2021/20210213_GDC200_3/index.html" data-size="full-width"></iframe></figure><p >The makers of these eight vaccines have signed contracts to deliver 7.9bn doses this year, and say they have capacity to fulfil orders for 4.3bn more. Of these, only a small fraction have already been produced, and manufacturing delays are likely. Moreover, even after jabs leave the factory, getting them into people’s arms can take months. Nonetheless, at least in theory, vaccine makers should be able to produce 2.1 shots—more than a full regimen—for each of the world’s 5.8bn adults by the end of 2021. (Children are not yet eligible, pending research on safety and efficacy.)</p><p >Yet even if all goes according to plan, much of the world will suffer a longer wait, because jabs will be distributed unequally. The 54 richest countries account for 18% of adults on Earth, but 40% of vaccine orders—enough to give each of their adults 2.5 two-dose regimens. Even though the <small>EU</small> has contracted for more vaccines than it can use, some member states, like Germany, have made their own deals. Canada has ordered a whopping 11 doses per adult.</p><figure  data-infographic-></figure><figure><iframe height="NaN" src="https://infographics.economist.com/2021/20210213_GDC200_2/index.html" data-size="full-width"></iframe></figure><p >Elsewhere, expected supply is tighter, at 1.5 doses ordered per adult. Russia and China can probably make do with their domestic jabs. And the Serum Institute, the world’s biggest vaccine maker, plans to save half of its output for local use in India.</p><p >Many other countries are relying on <small>COVAX</small>, a global coalition to distribute covid-19 vaccines. It is expected to provide at least 1.8bn doses to 92 poor and middle-income countries this year, in proportion to their populations (though subsequent allocations will depend on where the pandemic is most severe). Weighting by total population favours countries with lots of children, who count when determining vaccine quantities but are unlikely to get the shots. For example, Niger, where 50% of people are aged under 15, will receive 2.1 doses for every adult from <small>COVAX</small>. In contrast, North Korea, whose adults make up 80% of the population, will get just 0.7 doses for each one. <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p><p data-interactive- >Sources: Airfinity; Gavi; Max Roser, Our World in Data; United Nations; World Bank; <i>The Economist</i></p><figure data-infographic-js="1"></figure><p data-test-id="Footnote" >This article appeared in the Graphic detail section of the print edition under the headline &quot;Jabs and jab-nots&quot;</p>
