But he comes across an injustice and intervenes, overpowering the thugs foolish enough to challenge him. He then becomes dragged into a battle against a much wider threat—perhaps consisting of corrupt cops, drug gangs and foreign spies—and vanquishes his foes. Then he sets off again on his lonely journey.</p><p >It is an old plot, with echoes of the <em>ronin</em> (itinerant Japanese samurai), Clint Eastwood’s Westerns and “The Incredible Hulk”, a TV spin-off of Marvel comic books, broadcast from 1978 to 1982. It is also the format of the vast majority of novels about Jack Reacher, the former military policeman created by Lee Child. “The Sentinel”, which was published on October 27th, is the 25th book in the series and marks a turning-point: it has been co-written with the author’s brother, Andrew, to whom Mr Child is handing over the literary baton.</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p >The books have been remarkably successful, selling more than 100m copies worldwide and spawning two modestly received films starring Tom Cruise as well as a forthcoming TV series from Amazon. (Critics and fans thought the diminutive Mr Cruise, pictured, was miscast as the towering Reacher.) Mr Child writes in sparse, efficient prose that keeps readers turning the page. The fights, which the author describes in minute detail, tend to be the best bits. Some of his opponents are killed but the reader is never in doubt that they are bad guys, and such deaths cause the hero little regret or moral consternation.</p><p >As well as being a deadly combatant, Reacher is an ace detective, a character trait that has become more prominent as the series has progressed. He usually finds a female ally in the police, FBI or army to help him uncover the conspiracy (and to keep him company in bed). Though the hero has a robust stance on fighting crime and sticks up for the downtrodden, Mr Child has rarely reached for political significance. Reacher’s first appearance was in 1997, during Bill Clinton’s presidency, and the character has tended to keep his political opinions to himself. The result is generally an entertaining, untroubling beach read.</p><p >“The Sentinel” has these usual ingredients but the formula feels a little tired. The middle section gets bogged down as Reacher and his associates search for MacGuffins, in this case a set of computer servers, in town dumps and warehouses. These servers are revealed to be part of a conspiracy that seems both complex and contrived. Fans may enjoy it but new readers would be advised to start at the beginning of the series, where the character seems fresher and more vital.</p><p >Yet there is no reason in theory why Reacher cannot go on thumping bad guys far into the future. (On any rational timescale, the character should have taken his pension by now, but gritty realism is hardly the point of such novels.) If he wants to emulate his brother’s success, Andrew Child might be advised to keep the plots simple and the action flowing.</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p ><strong>The Sentinel.</strong> By Lee Child and Andrew Child. <em>Random House; 368 pages; $28.99.
