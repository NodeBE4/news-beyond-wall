I have dreads”—he smiles as he lifts his dreadlocks to reveal a shaved patch—“though they did try to cut them off.” He is referring to the guards at the prison in Khartoum where he was held in September on “public nuisance” charges. As part of an artistic collective called Civic Lab, the film-maker had been participating in a theatre workshop when the police intervened on the grounds that both men and women were shamelessly present at the same event. </p><p >He and four fellow artists were released after ten days, but the incident was a reminder that Sudan’s revolution did not suddenly create a liberal society. In December 2018 <a href="https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2019/04/08/protests-against-the-rule-of-omar-al-bashir-in-sudan-are-growing">millions took to the streets</a> to denounce a murderous dictatorship. The protests culminated in a coup d’etat in April 2019, which pushed out the dictator, Omar al-Bashir, and ushered in a transition towards democracy which is still in progress. However, Sudan’s penal code, largely based on sharia (Islamic law), remains extremely strict. Hardliners use a vaguely worded ban on “indecent public behaviour” to curb mixed-sex socialising and curtail women’s freedoms. </p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p >Mr Kuka says his idea of home was always complicated: his family moved from Khartoum to the United Arab Emirates when he was five, where he finished high school. After a degree in mechanical engineering at the American University of Beirut, he decided to commit to a creative path. After completing a degree in digital design at San Jose State University, California, in 2004, Mr Kuka worked in video editing in Washington and New York. </p><p >He returned when conflict broke out in 2011 in South Kordofan and Blue Nile states between the Sudanese army and the Sudan People’s Liberation Movement-North (SPLM-N), a militant group. The armed insurrections in these two states have their roots in the decades-long war that led to South Sudan’s independence in July 2011. Many people in South Kordofan and Blue Nile had fought on the same side as the South Sudanese secessionists, but the two regions ended up staying in the north, seeking better representation. When Khartoum tried to disarm soldiers in Blue Nile state, they resisted, bloodily. Mr Kuka decided to make a film about the Nuba people, who live around the Nuba mountains, close to the border with South Sudan; many of them had suddenly become refugees. He settled in Kauda, a separatist-held town in the mountains, to document the atrocities being committed. </p><p >“Beats of the Antonov” captures both the battle over identity that drives the conflict between the Sudanese army and the rebels, and the rich musical traditions of the Nuba people. The beat of drums and the songs of women meld with the roars of the army planes overhead. “Music from a certain place has a certain rhythm—if you resonate with that rhythm, you understand a landscape and a people,” Mr Kuka believes. The film was released in 2014 to global acclaim, winning awards at film festivals in Durban, San Francisco and Toronto. Cameron Bailey, the artistic director of the Toronto International Film Festival, says that “[Mr] Kuka represents the creativity, brilliance and generosity of Sudan better than anyone I’ve ever seen.”</p><p >After the promotional tour was over, Mr Kuka returned to Kauda. The conflict was escalating. Amnesty International reported in 2015 that Sudanese government forces were committing war crimes against civilians in South Kordofan. Mr Kuka captured the first footage of the bombing of a primary school in Kauda on May 25th 2016 and uploaded it online. Liz Chege, the director of the Africa in Motion film festival, based in Edinburgh, emphasises that Mr Kuka’s work is significant “not just within the frame of African cinema history, but also within the context of the global fight for human rights.”</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p >Life in Kauda was divided into two seasons: the fighting one and the rainy one. The conflict would pause during the rainy season, when tanks could not get through the mud. Mr Kuka passed the 2016 and 2017 rainy seasons hosting drama workshops and making short films. “These films were for ourselves, and most were never shown outside of Nuba.” During the fighting seasons, he worked on a script for his first fiction feature. Shooting on “aKasha” (2018) lasted throughout the rainy season in 2017. A romantic comedy set against the backdrop of the conflict, “aKasha” follows an overbearing revolutionary war hero and his less-than-impressed girlfriend.</p><p >For Mr Kuka, the purpose of the arts is to foster resilience. “The thing about resisting a system that took over life in a country completely—like the dictatorship that was Sudan—is that it takes a long time. It needs to be fun for people to keep at it. That’s where art helps,” Mr Kuka argues. Giving meaning to people’s experiences is its equally important task. “It’s boring to get politicians or academics to talk to you about what people are fighting for. But film is different.” Screening “Beats of the Antonov” and “aKasha” for Nuba viewers gave them a much-needed space to talk openly about the war, he says. Steven Markovitz, a producer, has been struck by how Mr Kuka “is always willing to listen to other people’s ideas. One can feel the activism in his work without it being preachy or predictable.”</p><p >Mr Kuka is undaunted by his recent stint in prison. He hopes to continue the Civic Lab theatre workshops. There is also a documentary in the works about the Khartoum sit-in of spring 2019; a film adaptation of a “funny, sarcastic” Eritrean novella about migration; and a sci-fi feature about a group of ordinary Africans who get to decide the direction of global tech research. All will blend humour with struggles for justice. He hopes they will “keep young people engaged—because they are the ones ready to imagine a different future, and they have the energy to fight for it.”</p>
