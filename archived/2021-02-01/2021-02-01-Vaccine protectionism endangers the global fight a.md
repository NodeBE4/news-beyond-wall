The EU has ordered 1.7bn doses of vaccines (with options for 600m more) from six manufacturers. The EU’s medicines agency has so far approved three for use, of which it has ordered about 1bn doses—nearly enough for three jabs for every adult in the bloc. But the roll-out of these programmes has been slow, in part because the EU has insisted on a more thorough approval process. To date EU countries have together administered 12.6m doses of the vaccine, or 2.8 per 100 people. In contrast Britain, which on December 8th became the first country in the world to begin a mass vaccination drive, has administered 14.4 per 100 people.</p><p >But only a small share of the doses on order have been delivered. Production delays have prompted a row with AstraZeneca, a British-Swedish drugmaker. The EU had hoped that the firm would deliver 80m of the 300m doses contracted for by the end of March. But AstraZeneca told the EU last week that delays at its Dutch and Belgian plants meant that it could deliver less than half that number.</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p >The dispute threatens to descend into a tit-for-tat vaccine war, and set back efforts to stop the spread of the coronavirus. The EU suggested that the shortfall could be made up from plants in Britain, which are together expected to produce 80m doses this year. But AstraZeneca says the output from Britain must first fulfil the British government’s order of 100m doses. In response, the EU announced a “transparency and authorisation mechanism” whereby EU member states could prevent the export of vaccines from their countries if the company had not first honoured its contract to supply the EU. This, in turn, has the potential to disrupt Britain’s order of 40m vaccines from Pfizer-BioNTech (though both sides claim that will not happen). On January 29th the European Commission invoked a provision in the Brexit agreements to impose checks on the Northern Irish border and prevent the export of vaccines to Britain; amid outrage in London, Dublin and Belfast, it quickly reversed its decision.</p><p >Data from Airfinity, a science-analytics company, demonstrates the complexity of these supply chains. The world has enough manufacturing capacity to produce 16bn doses of covid-19 vaccine this year, of which 3.3bn doses are planned to be produced in the EU. The drugmakers with which the EU has signed contracts will produce 8.4bn doses, and 2.7bn of those within the bloc (see chart).</p><p >That should be more than enough to go around, but also gives Europe’s politicians ample opportunity to hold up deliveries of vaccines abroad should they find themselves falling short. On January 31st Ursula von der Leyen, the European Commission president, announced that AstraZeneca had agreed to deliver an extra 9m doses to the EU in the first quarter of this year, although that will take the total to only 40m, half of what the bloc had expected. That vaccines were developed at all, and in the space of just a year, should be something to celebrate. The threat of export controls that looms over drugmakers and countries alike would not only choke the global supply of vaccines but the sense of hope and co-operation that goes with it.</p>
