Security-camera footage showed a dozen masked police officers breaking into the headquarters of Alexei Navalny, the opposition leader, whose return to Moscow after a near fatal-poisoning had inspired the crackdown. Meanwhile his wife, Yulia Navalnya, shot a video on her phone as officers pounded on the door of the couple’s flat. Elsewhere in Moscow, the apartments of Mr Navalny’s allies were being searched and their occupants taken in for questioning over anti-Kremlin protests that were staged <a href="https://www.economist.com/europe/2021/01/31/shades-of-minsk-as-russians-again-protest-against-putin">across Russia</a> the previous weekend.</p><p >One of the raids, however, was not like the others. When the police arrived to detain Anastasia Vasilyeva (pictured), the head of a medical union linked to Mr Navalny, she was ready. Not with her lawyer, or a suitcase packed for a spell in detention, but with a highly polished performance of Beethoven’s “Für Elise” on her white, upright piano; she had just reached the middle section when officials entered her flat. In a scene that combined the political farce of Armando Iannucci with the high camp of Pedro Almodóvar, the doctor played on even as an officer read out demands that she surrender her phone and computer for inspection. “You can applaud,” she told the officials, with a flick of her hair, as she released the last chord and turned her attention to their requests. </p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p >Dr Vasilyeva’s video of the raid immediately went viral, providing a rare moment of levity in an otherwise bleak month for the opposition. Police took her into custody, where she stayed for 48 hours. In a way, the clip could only be a product of modern Russia. This is a country where authorities raid their opponents homes on the flimsiest of pretexts but also, unlike the Soviet Union or China, it is a place where those same opponents can openly mock the authorities in front of a mass audience. The video has the same qualities as the YouTube investigations that have made Mr Navalny’s name as an anti-corruption activist and are causing ongoing headaches for the Kremlin: defiant, shareable and fun.</p><p >But in another sense, the image of Dr Vasilyeva at her piano as officers swarm around her harks back to an earlier, Soviet-era tradition: it is an illustration of the intelligentsia turning to art as a means of private resistance against the incursions of the state. Dmitri Shostakovich (who did keep a packed bag at the ready for when a knock at the door came) continued to compose music he knew would never be performed in his lifetime even as he produced work that would satisfy the authorities. Anna Akhmatova, who chronicled Stalinist repressions in her poem “Requiem”, persuaded friends to memorise the work so that it could exist outside the control of the Soviet censors. Other, more obscure members of the intelligentsia learned swathes of classical poetry by heart and performed it in the camps. </p><p >Soviet authorities understood the power of this artistic statement. “Poets are always right, history is on their side,” a Bolshevik official warned Stalin as he considered a punishment for Akhmatova’s friend, Osip Mandelstam, over an unpublished but critical verse. The intelligentsia believed this work would live on when the repressive state had disappeared, and they were partly right. Their poetry and music is now published and performed—yet the Kremlin is once again raiding the homes of its perceived enemies, though the consequences are much less deadly. As for Dr Vasilyeva’s intention when she sat down to play Beethoven, it is too early to know. Despite being released from police custody, at the time of writing she remains under house arrest and unable to comment publicly on her performance.</p>
