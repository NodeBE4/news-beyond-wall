It was the end of nearly two weeks of demonstrations in Lhasa, Tibet’s capital, during which protesters demanded Tibetan independence. The Dalai Lama, Tibet’s spiritual leader, fled into exile. The Chinese Communist Party’s victory laid the groundwork for the establishment of the Tibetan Autonomous Region (TAR) in 1965. The TAR was the People’s Republic of China’s fifth and last autonomous region. Since coming to power in 1949, the Communist Party had also established autonomous regions in Xinjiang (1955), Guangxi (1958) and Ningxia (1958) (Inner Mongolia had been an autonomous region since 1947). What are autonomous regions, and how do they differ from other parts of China?</p><div ><figure><div itemscope="" itemProp="image" itemType="https://schema.org/ImageObject" data-slim="1"><meta itemProp="url" content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/737/90/sites/default/files/images/2021/03/blogs/economist-explains/20210327_wom943.png"/><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/737/90/sites/default/files/images/2021/03/blogs/economist-explains/20210327_wom943.png"  sizes="300px" alt=""/></div></figure><p >Most people think of China as being divided up into provinces, in a similar system to the 50 states of America (though with power much less devolved). But as well as 22 provinces, and, in Hong Kong and Macau, two “special administrative regions”, China has five autonomous regions and four municipalities (Beijing, Chongqing, Shanghai and Tianjin). These different types of administrative regions all have top-tier status in China: they each have their own governor or mayor, who is subordinate to the local Communist Party secretary. But according to Chinese law, autonomous regions “have the right to formulate self-government regulations...in light of the particular political, economic and cultural conditions of the ethnic group in that autonomous area.” The distinction may seem marginal—many people assume that Xinjiang and Tibet are provinces like any other—but the supposed provisions of heightened autonomy are part of the Communist Party’s narrative that it is a protector rather than an oppressor of ethnic minorities. It even designates more than 100 minority-populated counties and prefectures in other provinces as “autonomous”.</p><p >More than 90% of Chinese people are of the Han ethnicity, but there are 56 officially recognised ethnic groups. When Xinjiang became an autonomous region in 1955, Uyghurs, a predominantly Muslim group, made up 73% of the population (in 2010, the last time there was a census, that figure had fallen to 46%). Some 90% of people in Tibet are ethnic Tibetans, according to China’s official statistics. Guangxi, Inner Mongolia and Ningxia all have much smaller ethnic-minority populations. The governor of any autonomous region comes from the dominant ethnic group, who will supposedly champion its interests (although he is subservient to the local party chief, who will normally be Han.) Officially, autonomous regions include guarantees of religious freedom (which is also guaranteed nationally) and of the right to use local languages, rather than Mandarin. </p><p >But these areas, which are supposed to offer greater protections to ethnic minorities, are often <a href="https://www.economist.com/united-states/2021/02/13/can-americas-government-deal-with-chinas-after-accusing-it-of-genocide">better-known for their brutal treatment</a>. In 2020 the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, a think-tank, estimated that 65% of Xinjiang’s mosques had been damaged or destroyed as a result of government policies since 2017. <a href="https://www.economist.com/china/2021/02/13/as-in-xinjiang-china-is-tightening-its-grip-in-tibet">Tibetans live in a surveillance state</a> which, although not as severe as Xinjiang’s, can result in prison sentences for people who post online about the Dalai Lama. Mandarin has replaced Tibetan in most schools. Chen Quanguo, the party secretary of Xinjiang, was previously posted in Tibet, where he developed some of these heavy-handed security tactics. Shohrat Zakir, Xinjiang’s Uyghur governor, whom Mr Chen oversees, has done little to prevent the targeting of fellow Uyghurs in his region—if indeed he has had any opportunity.</p><p >Figures such as Mr Zakir and Che Dalha, the governor of Tibet who is an ethnic Tibetan, prop up the Communist Party’s claims to celebrate China’s ethnic diversity. Much as votes at the National People’s Congress (NPC), China’s rubber-stamp parliament, always contain one or two dissenters to uphold the façade of debate, images of a handful of delegates dressed in traditional ethnic-minority outfits present a diversity in Chinese politics that is unmatched by reality. People in Western countries often complain that minorities are underrepresented in their halls of power. In China, the opposite appears true: ethnic minorities make up 8% of the population, but 15% of the delegates to the NPC. Such visibility is probably of little comfort to the Kazakhs, Uyghurs, Tibetans and other minorities who are detained in prison camps. What is the difference between China’s autonomous regions and provinces? Contrary to what the Communist Party would have you believe, the answer is very little. </p></div>
