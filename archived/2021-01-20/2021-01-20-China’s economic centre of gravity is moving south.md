Online pundits have recently updated the maxim to “don’t invest outside the Southern Song”, a dynasty that fell almost 750 years ago whose territory was roughly the same as China’s southern half today. The joke contains a kernel of truth: China’s southern provinces are outperforming northern ones in nearly every economic dimension.</p><p >On January 18th China announced that its GDP grew by 2.3% in 2020, making it one of the few countries to expand in the virus-blighted year. The recovery was unbalanced, with factories at full throttle but consumption subdued. Things should improve after the pandemic ends, as people move around more. The north-south imbalance, by contrast, was worsening before covid-19 and is likely to outlast it.</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p >The south’s share of GDP has risen to 65%, up from 60% five years ago and the highest on record. Some of that is a matter of luck. The north, home to China’s largest coal mines and oil reserves, was caught out by the fall in commodity prices after 2013. It also boasts big industrial firms, from steelmakers to chemical giants. China’s shift away from construction-fuelled growth towards consumption and services has hurt.</p><p >Other factors are at work, too. Partly because of their industrial heritage, northern provinces have strong command-economy tendencies. An analyst with a credit-rating agency recently asked officials in Tianjin, a struggling northern city, whether they would allow more defaults by state-owned firms. “Market solutions work best in the south,” was the reply, he says. Officials in the north tried harder to goose up growth, to the region’s detriment. In 2013, the peak of China’s building frenzy, investment in assets such as roads and factories accounted for an eye-watering 66% of GDP in the north versus 51% in the south. (Provisional data do not always match national figures.)</p><p >Local governments in the south have been more hands-off. China’s two most dynamic regions, home to its greatest concentration of private firms and tech startups, are in the south, anchored by Shanghai and Shenzhen. The south is also a trading dynamo, making the smartphones, sofas and spandex lapped up globally. Its foreign-trade surplus last year was roughly 7% of GDP. The north ran a 2% deficit.</p><p >Adding insult to injury, the north has also been disrupted more by sporadic covid-19 outbreaks in recent months. Millions of people in Hebei, a province that makes about a quarter of China’s steel, are now locked down. Geography seems part of the problem: a harsher northern winter makes the virus more transmissible. The north is stuck out in the cold.</p>
