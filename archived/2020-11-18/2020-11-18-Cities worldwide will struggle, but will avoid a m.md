E.B. White, an American essayist, worried in 1948 that New York could be destroyed by “a single flight of planes no bigger than a wedge of geese” dropping bombs on it. Great cities have been razed or have descended into anarchy in a great many films and books, from “War of the Worlds” to “High-Rise” and “Godzilla”. That a new virus should strike cities so hard does not seem too surprising.</p><p >Covid-19 did not just break out in large metropolises, killing their inhabitants before doctors knew how to treat the disease. It also induced a protective response that has been exceptionally hard on cities. When public transport, theatres, nightclubs and offices are forced to close, or when people are afraid to visit them, the impact on villages and small towns is minimal. Cities, by contrast, almost stop functioning.</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p >In the initial panic, many urbanites fled. Mobile-phone records suggest that 17% of Parisians departed in the week before France was locked down in March. Over the following months, city-dwellers in many countries recalibrated their attitudes to property. A poll by Ipsos mori in June 2020 found that Britons of every generation prized a private garden above all other features of a home, including secure locks and a good internet connection. Suburbia had not looked so alluring for years.</p><p >So big cities will enter 2021 in an awful state. Offices will still be quiet; theatres will be closed; public-transport agencies will be begging governments for bail-outs. The army of urban service workers—the coffee-pourers, nail-painters, sandwich-makers and yoga instructors—will still be struggling to pay the rent. But by the end of the year things will be looking up again.</p><p >Cities will recover not because a covid-19 vaccine or better treatments appear, although those would help greatly, but because of their innate capacity for change. Adapting to shocks is what great cities do. As previous industries withered, they turned cotton warehouses into offices, railway lines into parks and slaughterhouses into boutiques. If shops and offices are abandoned, urbanites will find new uses for them. This flexibility seemed to hurt cities during the pandemic, as white-collar workers switched to working from home and stopped buying bus tickets and sandwiches. But not adapting would have been calamitous.</p><p >Cities’ power to assemble talented people remains strong. The Black Lives Matter protests and a rash of illegal urban raves have shown that young city-dwellers still want to congregate. Middle-aged office workers may feel differently. Yet predictions that knowledge industries will abandon city centres for a network of small satellite offices misunderstand the purpose of offices. They are not for making phone calls or tapping at computers, but for sharing ideas. A hub is essential; a suburban satellite office may not be much of an improvement on a converted bedroom.</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p >Some urbanites will move to suburbs and small towns. They have long done so: it is almost a feature of great global cities that they have a negative balance of domestic migration, and rely on babies and immigrants to keep up their numbers. But anybody who believes that the outflow will turn into a flood has perhaps not tried to get planning permission for a house or a block of flats in the suburbs recently. Cities will hit the ground hard, then bounce.</p><p ><em>Joel Budd: social affairs editor, The Economist</em> <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p><p ><em>This article appeared in the International section of the print edition of The World in 2021 under the headline “Concrete jumble”</em></p>
