In a policy statement, the central bank also said it would keep them there until inflation is on track to “moderately exceed” its target of 2% “for some time”. <strong>Jay Powell, </strong>the chairman of the Fed, commented that America’s economic recovery is expected to slow and that the economy will require continued support from the central bank as well as from extra government spending.</p><p >American <strong>retail-sales </strong><strong>growth </strong>slowed to just 0.6% month-on-month in August, a lower figure than what economists had forecast. The unexpected softening in consumer demand followed the expiration of extra emergency jobless benefits worth $600 a week at the end of July.</p><div  id="gpt-ad-slot-1" data-test-id="Inline Ad"></div><p >Worries that <strong>Britain </strong>is at risk of deflation grew after the annual rate of <strong>inflation</strong> fell to 0.2% in August, down from 1% the previous month. The effect of the government’s discount scheme for restaurants in August may have contributed up to 0.5 percentage points of the drop.</p><h2>In the recovery ward</h2><p >In its quarterly economic forecast, following its most recent one in May, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development revised up <strong>growth forecasts </strong>for most countries it tracks. The intergovernmental think-tank said public spending was needed to support the economic recovery from the covid-19 lockdowns into 2021, albeit in a more targeted way, and that tax increases should be delayed. See <a href="https://www.economist.com/node/21791871">article</a>.</p><p ><strong>Bayer, </strong>a German chemicals firm, settled 15,000 lawsuits relating to <strong>Roundup, </strong>a weedkiller alleged to cause cancer, as part of an $11bn settlement. Bayer has estimated it faces a total of 125,000 filed and unfiled claims over Roundup.</p><div  id="gpt-ad-slot-2" data-test-id="Inline Ad"></div><p ><strong>President Donald Trump </strong>threatened to “do something” about the World Trade Organisation after it deemed that tariffs imposed by America on <strong>China </strong>in 2018 broke its rules. The <small>WTO</small> rejected America’s argument that the measures were justified by Chinese business practices, such as the theft of intellectual property, questioning whether the Chinese products in question had really benefited from them.</p><p ><strong>Oracle </strong>confirmed that it is ByteDance’s preferred American partner for <strong>TikTok</strong>. The impending deal comes after Mr Trump insisted that TikTok’s American arm be divested by ByteDance, the Chinese owner of the short-video platform, citing worries about national security. News reports suggest the firms hope that a proposal for Tiktok’s global operations to become an American-based company, with Oracle taking just a minority stake, will be enough to satisfy the White House. See <a href="https://www.economist.com/business/2020/09/16/who-are-the-tiktok-sagas-biggest-winners">article</a>.</p><p >The <strong>Trump administration </strong>announced restrictions on imports suspected of being made using forced labour in China’s <strong>Xinjiang </strong>region. Goods subject to sanctions include cotton and clothes; Xinjiang accounts for the vast majority of the country’s cotton production. China stands accused of human-rights abuses, such as interning an estimated 1m ethnic Uighurs in gulags, which it calls “re-education centres”.</p><h2>Seattle, we have a problem</h2><h2><figure><div itemscope="" itemProp="image" itemType="https://schema.org/ImageObject" data-slim="0"><meta itemProp="url" content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/720/90/sites/default/files/images/print-edition/20200919_WWP003_0.jpg"/><img src="https://images.weserv.nl/?url=www.economist.com/img/b/1280/720/90/sites/default/files/images/print-edition/20200919_WWP003_0.jpg"  sizes="(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw" alt=""/></div></figure></h2><p >The transportation committee of America’s House of Representatives published a critical report into the failures that led to two <strong>Boeing </strong>737 <small>MAX</small> jets crashing in just five months, killing 346 people. Design errors, lax government oversight of Boeing and a lack of transparency at the planemaker and its regulators “point to a company culture that is in serious need of a safety reset”, the report said.</p><p >Shares in <strong>Hennes &amp; Mauritz </strong>surged by 11% on the day it revealed better-than-expected third-quarter results. The world’s second-largest fashion retailer, which has its headquarters in Sweden, said profits in the three months to the end of August were around SKr 2bn ($222m), more than ten times higher than the average analyst forecast of just SKr 191m.</p><p ><strong>SoftBank, </strong>a Japanese tech firm, agreed to sell <strong>Arm</strong> to <strong>Nvidia,</strong> an American chipmaker. The takeover values the British chip designer, whose microprocessor blueprints are used in most of the world’s smartphones, at up to $40bn. Four years ago SoftBank bought Arm for $32bn. Nvidia has also promised to protect jobs at Arm and keep its headquarters in Cambridge.

The flotation of the fast-growing cloud-computing firm is the world’s largest-ever software <small>IPO</small>.
