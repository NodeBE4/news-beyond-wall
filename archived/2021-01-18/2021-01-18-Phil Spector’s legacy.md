How should he be remembered? As a murderer, who shot and killed Lana Clarkson, an actor, in 2003, for which he was sentenced to 19-years-to-life in 2009? As a monster, who had terrified women (including his second wife, Ronnie Spector) for many years and had used his status to behave appallingly towards numerous recording artists? Or as one of pop music’s greatest architects, the man who erected the “wall of sound” that blared out of transistor radios in the 1960s, when he was described by Tom Wolfe as “the first tycoon of teen”? </p><p >He was all of the above. He was also the founder of a cult of pop personality. Phil Spector was front and centre of everything to do with Phil Spector. He was the first producer whose name on a record label was as important as the artist’s; for a time it was more important. That is reinforced each Christmas, when tracks from the album “A Christmas Gift For You From Phil Spector” (1963) ring from shopping-centre PA systems, film soundtracks and TV adverts. Contrary to the title, the songs are performed by four named performers and a score of brilliant session musicians. </p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p >Mr Spector did not get away with being a monster because he made great records that sold in huge quantities. He did so because of that cult of personality, which in part existed because he was a man at a time when being a genius in pop was seen as a uniquely male preserve. Had any woman discharged firearms in the studio or held musicians hostage, as Mr Spector did, their career would have ended on the spot, whatever their level of talent. Even now, you only have to look at the opprobrium heaped on women artists perceived to be behaving as divas, or the contempt shown to those—including Amy Winehouse or Whitney Houston—whose personal troubles get the better of them, to recognise the discrepancy. Yet Mr Spector continued to be lionised long after stories about him were common knowledge and in the public record. The cult surely encouraged his sense of being untouchable, just as his childhood may have forged his personality in the first place (his father killed himself; his mother bullied him). </p><p >It also led to a misconception of his art. Yes, Mr Spector designed the wall of sound—a recording technique which created a richer, more textured tone—but he did not build it. Without a man named Larry Levine there could have been no such thing, for he was the recording engineer who worked out how to translate the sound Mr Spector was imagining into a reality. It was Levine who knew Mr Spector was bringing too many musicians into the studio to record them cleanly and who realised that using an echo-chamber device would make the room sound larger. He was able to separate instruments to make their individual impacts heard. Without Levine, Mr Spector’s productions wouldn’t have sounded dramatic: they would have sounded like an overwrought mess. (When Levine died in May 2008, his death was marked not by columns and tributes, but by short obituaries. No one recalled the hell of working with him—he was “a delight”, remembered Hal Blaine, a bassist who worked on many of the sessions.)</p><p >Nor would Mr Spector’s great records have sounded the same without the voices that sung them, such as The Crystals, The Ronettes and The Righteous Brothers, without the incredible musicians who played on them—not just Blaine, but Carol Kaye, Jack Nitzsche, Leon Russell and more—or without the people who wrote the songs, including great women songwriters such as Ellie Greenwich and Carole King. Think of what is often cited as his greatest achievement: “River Deep - Mountain High”, by Ike and Tina Turner. Would it have been the same without Ms Turner’s gloriously dramatic reading of the song? </p><p >It is telling of Mr Spector’s view of the world, himself and women that he evidently thought so. When he delivered the eulogy at the funeral of Ike Turner, another man with a history of violence towards women, in 2007, he said: “Ike made Tina the jewel she was”. Any number of backing singers, he claimed, “could have been Tina Turner”. Record sales and public affection for Ms Turner suggest something different. The records Mr Spector made were indelible, but they were not his alone. They were the work of a cast of thousands, and whenever they are played, it is the talent of the cast that should be celebrated.</p>
