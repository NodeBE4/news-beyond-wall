We were masked, of course, but this was far too close, so I moved several seats down and then felt awful. Without the mask I could have smiled at her, as if to say, “I’m sorry to do this, but I think we would both be safer if I did.” It would have been a softened look of apology, with a subtext that read: “Yes, we’re all in this together, and isn’t this a pain?” Instead I was expressionless behind blue fabric. Let’s face it, I was rude.</p><p >That would have been a lot to pack into a smile. Yet we all do it more or less continually – or used to – in our public lives. Smiles are capable of almost infinite variation and subtlety, and of split-second shifts, passing over like weather. The Rueful, when something hasn’t gone as planned. The Uneasy, when you’re not quite sure how the land lies. The Triumphant, just making it as the carriage door shuts, and the Relieved, as you settle back at the end of a long day. The False, the Febrile, the Delighted, the Empty, the Defensive, the Innocent, the Fixed. Not the least deprivation of the covid world is that all this variety is so often covered up. Eyes may be the mirrors of the soul, but they need the mouth to show what they mean.</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p >The broad and simple grin, the sort photographers try to draw from us with cries of “Cheese!” or, more oddly, “Sausages!” has always been a rare thing. I hate to see it in myself, my mouth setting into a toothy rictus until my eyes seem to vanish into my head. Such a picture once headed a column I wrote for a weekly magazine, proclaiming to readers – as I thought – what a silly, lightweight creature I was, no matter how serious the piece. I now favour a more restrained, ambivalent look, and there is a long history to that.</p><p >In the ancient world the only beings depicted with wide smiles were satyrs, centaurs and Bacchus, all drunk and disorderly. In the Middle Ages grins were sported by gargoyles, devils and other tormentors of virtuous men and women. The 17th century produced Murillo’s laughing beggars and a few convivial Dutchmen, before the late 18th brought the lippy, drooling smirks of kings and politicians in the cartoons of Gillray and Rowlandson. In the Victorian age only common people, like giggling schoolgirls or crowds at horse racing, gave way to unabashed smiles. The disembodied grin of Lewis Caroll’s Cheshire Cat is not funny, but almost dreadful.</p><figure data-image-nozoom="true"><div itemscope="" itemProp="image" itemType="https://schema.org/ImageObject"><meta itemProp="url" content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/1187/90/1843magazine.com/sites/default/files/1843_20210118_UF_STSMILES_002_0.jpg"/><img loading="lazy" width="1280" height="1187" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/1187/90/1843magazine.com/sites/default/files/1843_20210118_UF_STSMILES_002_0.jpg"  sizes="(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw" alt=""/></div></figure><p >How odd it would seem to any of those ancestors to see how the world now turns on the host of beaming faces inviting us to see shows, eat noodles, buy sofas or fly to Spain (assuming we’re allowed to do any of these). Smiles have become the natural currency of summits between world leaders, as well as picnics among friends. The look is no longer as fashionable as in the days when a trip to Skegness, or a perfect Victoria sponge, had to be celebrated with a dazzle of perfect dentistry. Nothing is so resolutely sulky as a 21st-century model on a catwalk. Nonetheless most of us, leaning in for a selfie, naturally summon up a smile.</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p >Perhaps we try too hard. Previous ages understood that the greatest allure, and the most potent suggestion of mysterious power and wisdom, lay in a very slight parting of the lips and an even slighter narrowing of the eyes: the shadow of a smile that might yet grow, but was as likely to disappear. This was how gods and especially goddesses looked on the world, as if they breathed more sacred air or were faintly amused at the silliness of mere humans. The Great Sphinx, too, has this expression, perhaps of rapt contemplation of the mysteries it still presides over (the Egyptian sculptor who worked for decades to restore it felt it was alive and was thanking him for his attentions).</p><p >Such half-smiles can be curiously haunting. They certainly explain the draw of the “Mona Lisa”, whose drab and yellowish portrait in the Louvre was – before covid – continuously thronged with fans. Personally I find her smile (the Knowing and Self-Satisfied) quite off-putting, as it is whenever I meet it on a living face. Give me instead Leonardo’s “Lady with the Ermine”, whose smile is unsure and shy and therefore captivating.</p><blockquote><p>Smiles are the hooks by which we are drawn into each other’s lives, if only for a moment</p></blockquote><p >But sometimes these days I find myself thinking, give me a smile of any sort. Let me read the passing weather of humanity again as I used to on the now-masked buses and trains, the platforms and streets, and in the shops. Smiles are the hooks by which we are drawn into each other’s lives, if only for a moment. They make a web of community, however slight. Perhaps, if I ever see that woman on the Gatwick train again, I’ll be able to try out a friendlier repertoire: the Recognising, the Smoothing Over, the Quietly Happy. And then, perhaps, the Sphinx.<span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p><p >ILLUSTRATIONS: <strong>ANTONELLO SILVERINI</strong></p>
