Convoluted negotiations to form a new government are under way. Whatever the outcome, Italy will have its 69th government since the end of the second world war—on average, one every 13 months. Why does Italy have so many short-lived governments?</p><p >The turnover is actually more apparent than real. Since it is not the prime minister but Italy’s president who formally appoints ministers, the head of government normally has to resign to reshuffle his cabinet or coalition (there has never been a woman prime minister). Thus, Silvio Berlusconi was in office continually from 2001 to 2006. But in 2005 he changed around his ministers, so technically he had two governments in succession. Apply the same rules to France and you find it has had even more cabinets than Italy over the same period (more than 70).</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p >But there are two important differences. France’s turnover was concentrated in the days of its Fourth Republic, before 1959. And since it is the president in France who wields the real clout, changes of prime minister tend not to be accompanied by such radical changes of direction as occur nowadays in Italy—even, sometimes, without a change of prime minister. Mr Conte’s first cabinet, from 2018 to 2019, was a coalition of the left-leaning, populist Five Star Movement (M5S) and the hard-right Northern League. His second, which is still in office looking after day-to-day administration, brought together the M5S and the centre-left Democratic Party (PD).</p><p >The conventional explanation for Italy’s governmental instability lies with the peculiar nature of its cold-war politics. The Italian Communist Party (PCI) was the biggest in western Europe. To keep it out of power, the centre-right Christian Democrats formed an endless series of coalitions with the remaining parties. Until a socialist, Bettino Craxi, became prime minister in 1983, a fair bit of continuity underlay the frequent turmoil. But since the end of the cold war, Italy has continued to lurch from one melodramatic crisis to the next. Since the fall of the Berlin Wall, it has had 19 governments lasting on average just over 18 months.</p><p >One reason is Italy’s reliance on proportional representation, which creates a multiplicity of parties. Electoral laws, including the current one, have encouraged the formation of coalitions, by introducing thresholds for entry to parliament and/or an element of first-past-the-post. But that does not prevent electoral coalitions disintegrating once the votes are in. Matteo Renzi, a former prime minister who prompted the latest crisis, was elected in 2018 for the PD. Soon afterwards he formed his own party, Italia Viva. His followers have only 18 of the 321 seats in the upper house, the Senate, but that was enough to rob Mr Conte of an overall majority.</p><p >At the root of Italy’s political instability is the readiness of Italian lawmakers to abandon the parties for which they were elected—a constant in the country’s democratic politics since the late 19th century. Of the 945 deputies and senators elected at the last general election, 147 had changed parties by the end of 2020. Beppe Grillo, the founder of the M5S, has argued that turncoats should resign their seats. No such obligation exists in America, yet legislators there “cross the aisle” far less than in Italy. Most explanations thus fall back on cultural and historical factors, such as Italy’s long, pre-unification experience of rule by undependable foreigners and the resulting dangers of being seen to be loyal to any one faction. Ultimately, though, such explanations are mere guesses.</p>
