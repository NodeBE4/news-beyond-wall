Davies’s moving portrait of a group of 18-year-old gay flatmates as AIDS rips through London, but the upbeat soundtrack of the ’80s grows ever more at odds with the bleak reality of the epidemic. As the strobe lights of dancefloors become the strip lights of hospitals, the hits of Kim Wilde, Joy Division and Wham!, among others, serve as cruel reminders of the early exuberance of characters who either die young or grow up quickly—manning information hotlines and processing from one funeral to another.</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p >Watching now, as the world confronts another plague, it is hard not to draw parallels between the initial responses to covid-19 and AIDS. As with covid “super-spreaders”, victims are blamed; even as the virus takes root, many deny its peril. Above all, misinformation flourishes. In one powerful scene, Ritchie (Olly Alexander) rattles through a long list of theories about the virus, dismissing each in turn. In another, he breezily reassures a man who catches his eye about the risk of AIDS, initially associated with deaths in San Francisco: “It’s Americans you don’t sleep with, not Londoners.” </p><p >Yet this accident of timing (the series was conceived and commissioned before covid-19) underscores one significant difference between the two plagues. Mr Davies has said he wanted his drama to chart how a generation was “wiped out quietly” while people went on “having their tea and watching the television”. After a year in which every viewer has been exposed to relentless public-health campaigns and news bulletins covering every development of covid-19, his portrayal of a society indifferent or even hostile to the ever-growing number of victims is all the starker. </p><p >The series is at its weakest when most overtly political, as in a lengthy scene in which Ash (Nathaniel Curtis), a teacher, recounts being forced by colleagues to hunt through books to excise any with positive portrayals of gay relationships. Arthur Garrison, a careerist and hypocritical Tory politician (Stephen Fry), is as superfluous to the plot as his presence is inevitable.</p><p >Still, the show is a fitting memorial to the human tragedy of that epidemic, contrasting the main characters’ gleeful escapes to the lights and liberation of London with the brutal finality of their journeys home to die. It is a long time since Mr Davies created Britain’s first gay drama, “Queer as Folk”, in 1999. “It’s a Sin” suggests he has lost none of his knack for capturing ordinary gay lives, even in their darkest moments.</p><p ><em>“It’s a Sin” is streaming on All 4 in Britain now. It will be available in America on HBO Max from February 18th</em></p>
