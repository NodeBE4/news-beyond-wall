Perhaps baking banana bread and hosting Zoom quizzes didn’t tempt them, as Mr Levinson used lockdown to write a screenplay for a drama which could be shot quickly and safely, using a tiny cast and crew. The resulting two-hander, “Malcolm &amp; Marie”, is a gesture of defiance. If your actors and their setting are sufficiently attractive, not even the coronavirus can stop you from making a film.</p><p >That all-round attractiveness is indisputable. Zendaya (“The Greatest Showman”, “Spider-Man: Homecoming”) stars alongside John David Washington (“BlackKklansman”, “Tenet”) as a sexy young showbiz power couple. He is Malcolm, a writer-director who is tipped to be the next Spike Lee, and she is Marie, a former actress who now works as Malcolm’s assistant and muse. The setting is their rented home in Malibu, California, a sleek, stylish, glass and concrete house to which they have returned at one o’clock after the evening premiere of Malcolm’s latest film. He is in a designer suit and she is in a tight silver dress, and because “Malcolm &amp; Marie” is shot in flattering black and white, the whole thing looks like an advert for expensive perfume. </p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p >Malcolm is on cloud nine as he pours himself a drink and dances to James Brown, buoyed by what he sees as his life-changing success. His previous films haven’t gone down well, but this one “delivered a knock-out punch”, he crows. “The white guy from <em>Variety</em> loved it, the white guy from IndieWire loved it, the white woman from the <em>LA Times</em> really loved it!” But eventually Malcolm notices how brusque Marie is being, and, after much prompting, she tells him why: when he was introducing the film, Malcolm thanked everyone except her.</p><p >Mr Levinson’s screenplay was inspired by an equivalent gaffe of his own, when he forgot to thank his wife while introducing his previous film, “Assassination Nation”. This personal experience could be why the couple’s quarrel has such a clear ring of truth. Marie is reluctant to air her grievances, but isn’t going to relax, either; Malcolm is caught between the urge to score points off Marie, and to shovel down the macaroni cheese she has just prepared. Anyone who has ever come home from a party with a partner, having irritated or been irritated by them, will shudder in recognition. </p><p >One shrewdly observed aspect of the squabble is that it fizzles out after half an hour: Mr Levinson notes the way that some couples can flick from furious recriminations to calm chit-chat within seconds. The downside of this speedy rapprochement is that it leaves “Malcom &amp; Marie” with more than an hour and a quarter to fill. Another film might have taken the plot somewhere new and surprising. This one, unfortunately, has Marie restarting the same argument. And then, when it’s settled a second time, she restarts the argument again. The characters stomp to different parts of their swanky house, and Marie changes out of her party dress, but otherwise there is so little variation that the conflict, which plays out in real-time, is exhaustingly repetitive.</p><p >The insults become so vicious, too, that it becomes hard to believe that either Malcolm or Marie wouldn’t jump in the car and drive to the nearest hotel. And yet the dialogue is too mannered and academic to have the gut-punching intensity of the slanging matches in “Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?” and the recent “Marriage Story”. Mr Levinson favours long and polished speeches which sound more like essays and polysyllabic beat poems than actual conversation. “Your lack of curiosity,” says Marie, “is merely an extension of your narcissism, your megalomania, your egotistical view of the world.” Malcolm, meanwhile, uses the fight as a pretext to debate whether films should be political and whether cinema is an inherently capitalist medium. Having started with themes that might resonate with anyone, the screenplay narrows its focus to film-industry talking points.</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p >Many of the topics seem to be pre-empting criticism of “Malcolm &amp; Marie” itself. Yes, the dialogue is off-puttingly artificial, but the screenplay anticipates this objection by having Malcolm say that authenticity is an overrated quality. Marie is in skimpy underwear for half the running time, but Malcolm remarks that it wouldn’t be sexist if a female character happened to be showing that much skin onscreen. Mr Levinson is white while Malcolm is fixated on his status as a black film-maker; the screenplay heads off this issue, too, by having Malcolm argue that a director’s cultural identity is irrelevant to an appreciation of their work. Essentially, Mr Levinson has made a film about whether he should have been allowed to make that very film—and “Malcolm &amp; Marie” is just as tiresomely self-regarding as that implies.</p><p >Viewers may end up wishing that he had remembered to thank his wife when he introduced “Assassination Nation”, so that he could have written about something else. “Malcolm &amp; Marie” stands as a big, shiny showcase for its committed stars, who get to shout, cry, dance and deliver lengthy monologues. Mr Washington proves to be a more limber and charismatic leading man than he was in “BlacKkKlansman” and “Tenet”, and the 24-year-old Zendaya completes her growth from Disney child star to serious heavyweight actor. But watching the film comes to feel like being woken by the noise of your next-door neighbours’ late-night row. At first, you might get an illicit thrill from hearing two people yell at each other, but after an hour, you just want them to shut up so you can get some sleep.</p><p ><em>“Malcolm &amp; Marie” is streaming on Netflix now</em></p><br><hr><div>获取更多RSS：<br><a href="https://feedx.net" style="color:orange" target="_blank">https://feedx.net</a> <br><a href="https://feedx.xyz" style="color:orange" target="_blank">https://feedx.xyz</a><br></div>
