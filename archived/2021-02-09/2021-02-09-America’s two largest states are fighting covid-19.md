In America, the two most populous states—California (the largest Democratic state) and Texas (its Republican rival)—have adopted strikingly different approaches to managing the pandemic. How well they have fared is significant to the health of the nation, since one-fifth of Americans live in the two states. Their relative fortunes also show how hard it is for states, which are in charge of America’s response to covid-19, to get the trade-offs right between lockdowns, economic damage and the spread of the virus—and show the limits of public policy when state borders are porous.</p><div ><figure ><figcaption>Listen to this story</figcaption><audio  controls="" id="audio-player" preload="metadata" src="https://www.economist.com/media-assets/audio/014%20United%20States%20-%20California%20v%20Texas%20v%20covid-19-1f5aab63e53f6e614e5305a2069fffdb.mp3" title="America’s two largest states are fighting covid-19 differently" controlsList="nodownload"><p>Your browser does not support the &lt;audio&gt; element.</p></audio></figure><p >Enjoy more audio and podcasts on<!-- --> <a id="audio-ios-cta" href="https://www.economist.comhttps://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1239397626?pt=344884&amp;ct=article%20audio%20player&amp;mt=8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">iOS</a> <!-- -->or<!-- --> <a id="audio-android-cta" href="https://www.economist.comhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.economist.lamarr&amp;referrer=utm_source%3Darticle%2520audio%2520player" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Android</a>.</p></div><p >Texas, ever sceptical of government, has taken a lighter-touch approach to public-health measures. Last year Greg Abbott, the governor, was slow to issue a mask mandate and fought cities and counties that wanted to implement stricter rules. Texas did issue a stay-at-home-order, but it was one of the first states to reopen, doing so even earlier than Donald Trump’s White House suggested. Cases spiked.</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p >In Texas the trade-off between public health and economic health largely played out in favour of business interests. Last year during lockdown, Dan Patrick, the histrionic lieutenant-governor, summed up this philosophy by arguing that “there are more important things than living” and claiming “lots of” grandparents were willing to die to save the economy. Underscoring the state’s view of business, on February 1st Mr Abbott used his state-of-the-state address to declare five “emergency items”. The only one related to covid-19 had nothing to do with stopping deaths, but instead was aimed at helping businesses, health-care providers and individuals to avoid covid-related lawsuits.</p><p >California, in contrast, has taken a more activist role in responding to the pandemic, says Jennifer Tolbert of the Kaiser Family Foundation, a non-profit. This reflects the state’s philosophy that government intervention can be a force for good. It was the first state to impose a shelter-in-place order last year and still has some of the strictest guidelines in the country. Until recently, the state banned even outdoor restaurant dining as it grappled with a winter surge of cases, prompting complaints and lawsuits from businesses. Not until January 25th did Governor Gavin Newsom announce that the state would lift, again, its stay-at-home order. Public schools have mostly remained closed for in-person learning, while those in Texas have been open since last autumn—by state decree.</p><p >Despite their contrasting approaches, the results have not been as different as expected. Texas has a higher death rate per person—only Arizona and South Carolina have fared worse, according to the <small>CDC</small>. But the gap is not as great as you might expect: Texas has had 127 deaths per 100,000 compared with 104 per 100,000 in California. “People in California are frustrated because they feel like they are experiencing the worst of both worlds,” says Ken Miller of Claremont McKenna college and author of the book “Texas vs California”. They have endured never-ending lockdowns, and yet deaths are currently higher than ever. Meanwhile, in Texas, the economic benefits of a more libertarian approach are hard to discern. The unemployment rate in both states is higher than the national average.</p><p >It is still too early to issue a post-mortem on why this is. But there are several factors that may help explain the states’ different experiences. First is the role of more infectious mutations. Anne Rimoin, a professor of epidemiology at <small>UCLA</small> School of Public Health, describes variants as “the big <small>X</small>-factor”. She thinks a variant may be one cause of the spike southern California saw in cases this winter, but it is too early to say so conclusively, because so little genomic sequencing and surveillance have been done. “As has been shown from the recent surge in California, the virus often wins, no matter what you try to do as a government,” says Larry Levitt of the Kaiser Family Foundation.</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-2"></div></div></div><h2>Lone Stars and lockdowns</h2><p >A second factor is the length of lockdowns people can tolerate before the policy becomes counterproductive. Most public-health experts believe that Texas was too quick to come out of its lockdown and paid the price with thousands of lives. Yet California has shown the limitations of long-lasting, intermittent lockdowns. The Golden State’s most recent ban on outdoor dining in the winter may have simply pushed private gatherings indoors, causing the virus to spread. Jay Bhattacharya, a professor of medicine at Stanford University, calls lockdowns “trickle-down epidemiology policy”, because they gave an advantage to the wealthy who could work from home, whereas poorer Californians had to go work, thereby running the risk of bringing the virus back to their families. That is a strange outcome for America’s most progressive state.</p><div ><figure><div itemscope="" itemProp="image" itemType="https://schema.org/ImageObject" data-slim="1"><meta itemProp="url" content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/1195/90/sites/default/files/images/print-edition/20210206_USC634.png"/><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/1195/90/sites/default/files/images/print-edition/20210206_USC634.png"  sizes="300px" alt=""/></div></figure><p >Even Mr Newsom got pandemic fatigue, dining indoors at the French Laundry, one of the country’s most expensive restaurants, with acquaintances in November after urging Californians to practise social distancing. Disapproval of his action has been mounting, and he is facing a recall campaign, which if it gathers enough signatures, will go on the ballot and could remove him from office. His Texan counterpart has also seen his approval ratings drop, but is not facing a political crisis.</p><p >A third factor explaining the pandemic’s toll in these two states is access to health care. Texas chose not to expand health-care coverage under the Affordable Care Act. Its share of uninsured adults and children (18%) is the highest in the country and twice the national average (in California, the figure is 8%). Lack of health care is probably one reason why Texan deaths per capita have been higher, although its inhabitants are more spread out. “Because there’s such a limited safety-net, you’re seeing people seek help and not getting it, but some people aren’t seeking help at all,” says Lina Hidalgo, county judge of Harris County in Texas. “Incredibly high numbers of people are dying at home.”</p><p >The pandemic has laid bare the shortcomings of both states. Texas has always been run lean, with few benefits for those who fall on hard times. California makes a point of offering more help to the needy, yet has been unable to deliver on its promises. The state’s inability to reopen public schools—which would require breaking with powerful teachers’ unions—has saddled the state’s neediest families with extra burdens. The administration of unemployment benefits in California has also been a disaster, resulting in delayed cheques to the needy and improperly paid ones to fraudsters, including some in jail. A state audit says the fraudulent claims could amount to as much as $30bn, or $20,000 for every unemployed Californian.</p><p >Getting their residents vaccinated will be the next test. The states that are currently doing best on that score, such as West Virginia, tend to be smaller. Texas’s roll-out was initially faster. It was early to expand vaccine eligibility beyond health-care workers to all those over 65, which helped speed up the roll-out. But a lack of a centralised booking system has led to many double bookings for shots. At one vaccination site in Dallas that your correspondent visited, 500 people are being vaccinated a day, but there are 100 no-shows, many of whom are suspected of booking elsewhere and forgetting to cancel. By contrast, California focused first on health-care workers and then those over 75. After a slow and chaotic start, California has picked up pace. In the past week California administered around 4 jabs per 1,000 people each day, compared with 2.8 in Texas.</p></div><p >Those Californians and Texans who hope the federal government may step in and fix glitches with vaccinations seem likely to be disappointed. “We thought they were going to bring in the army and the National Guard. Now we realise it was left entirely left to the states, but it doesn’t look like the states understood the complexity of what was involved,” says Peter Hotez of Baylor College of Medicine. Having muddled through the past year with opposite policies and quite similar results, America’s two biggest states must once more find their way back to normality themselves.<span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p><p ><strong>Dig deeper</strong></p><p ><em>All our stories relating to the pandemic and the vaccines can be found on our <a href="https://www.economist.com/news/2020/03/11/the-economists-coverage-of-the-coronavirus">coronavirus hub</a>.
