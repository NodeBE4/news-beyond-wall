Though it no longer serves its original purpose, it still stands at the windswept southern entrance to Chesapeake Bay as a monument to an early political compromise. Congress delivered it to Southern legislators in exchange for their support of a bill that placed lighthouses under federal control.</p><p >Legislative provisions that direct spending to a particular entity or place, like the one that financed the Cape Henry lighthouse, are known as earmarks. Long an essential part of congressional negotiations, they grew so reviled that in 2011, Congress banned them, and then-President Barack Obama refused to sign any bill that contained them. Recently, however, congressional Democrats signalled their intention to end the moratorium. Why?</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p >Earmarks, sometimes derisively called “pork-barrel spending”, allow legislators to distribute federal largesse in a targeted way: $20m for a highway here, $4m for a federal contractor there. They are attached to larger pieces of legislation and have historically served two main purposes. First, they let legislators deliver material benefits to their home districts, potentially improving their political standing. Second, they can serve as a bargaining chip, a way to win legislators’ support.</p><p >For critics, earmarks have long symbolised government waste and corruption, permitting self-serving legislators to gain popularity in their own states at the expense of taxpayers in others. In 1987 President Ronald Reagan famously vetoed a highway bill over its supposed profligacy. It contained 152 earmarks. In the presidential campaign of 2008, a $223m “bridge to nowhere” in a sparsely populated region of Alaska became a byword for waste. In 2010, with the federal budget deficit in the news, Tea Party candidates stormed to victory in congressional elections, promising to eliminate wasteful spending. They enacted the House moratorium the following year. Senate Republicans shortly followed suit, instituting a no-earmark rule that has persisted ever since.</p><p >Proponents of earmarks argue that they are an important part of the legislative bargaining process and a way to finance critical infrastructure. The fiscal impact of earmarks, advocates charge, has been overstated: they have historically comprised a minuscule part of the federal budget. And, most compellingly, supporters point out that the earmark ban does not eliminate the practice: it simply moves the power to direct specific funds to the executive branch, where the decision-making process may be less visible.</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p >Bringing earmarks back will be relatively simple. The moratorium is not settled law. It lives in party rules and accepted practice, and is enforced by party leaders through their agenda-setting power. Democrats, who now have a majority in both houses, can simply decide to end it.</p><p >But if earmarks are to be resurrected, some improvements might set sceptics’ minds at ease. The House and Senate can set transparency standards, requiring that all earmarks be listed on the web for public view. They can prohibit certain kinds of earmarks, such as those for projects named after the member requesting them. They can limit total earmark spending. Finally, they can require review by other government agencies to ensure that the money is being spent wisely, making it less likely that legislative bargaining will result in billion-dollar boondoggles.</p><p ><strong><em>Dig deeper</em></strong></p><p ><a href="https://www.economist.comhttps://www.economist.com/tracking-joe-biden"><em>We are tracking the Biden administration’s progress in its first 100 days</em></a></p>
