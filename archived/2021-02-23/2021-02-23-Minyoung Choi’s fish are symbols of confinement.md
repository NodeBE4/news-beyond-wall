The container is much too small—there is not enough room for the creature to turn around—and water slops over the side as it swishes its tail. The fish’s eyes are glassy and its mouth shaped into an eerie grin. For some, the image (pictured), painted last year, may symbolise the viewer’s own claustrophobia and bewilderment while living in lockdown.</p><p >Fish are a favourite subject of Minyoung Choi, a Korean artist now based in London. She has been fascinated with the animals since childhood, when she would gaze at the tropical aquarium in her family’s apartment in Seoul or read about her zodiac sign, Pisces. Boundaries are a central theme in Ms Choi’s work—between night and day, dreams and reality, freedom and confinement—and fish tanks have become a means of exploring this idea. </p><figure><div itemscope="" itemProp="image" itemType="https://schema.org/ImageObject" data-slim="0"><meta itemProp="url" content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/720/90/sites/default/files/images/2021/02/blogs/prospero/20210227_bkp504.jpg"/><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/720/90/sites/default/files/images/2021/02/blogs/prospero/20210227_bkp504.jpg"  sizes="(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw" alt=""/></div></figure><p >Many artists have been similarly inspired by marine life. <em>Gyotaku</em>, a Japanese method of printmaking which dates back to the mid-19th century, evolved from fishermen documenting their catches; the technique is still used all over the world. Henri Matisse produced a series of works of goldfish after becoming transfixed by the animals on a trip to Tangier in 1912, where he observed how locals would spend hours lost in their thoughts while peering into fishbowls. Goldfish are a motif of tranquility in the paintings of Sanyu, a 20th-century Chinese-French artist; one of his works was sold by Christie’s for HK$146m ($18.8m) in December. In East Asian folklore, goldfish are harbingers of good fortune and have the power to grant wishes. </p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p >Fish are often imbued with a sort of mystical appeal in Ms Choi’s work, too. In her watercolours, she juxtaposes small containers in the foreground with glorious sunsets beyond, mixing her trademark palette of blues and purples with yellows and oranges. Oil paintings show shoals glowing inside fluorescent aquariums, bringing enchantment to domestic settings. In “Desk 2” a workspace is visible through the water; stationery appears to float alongside the glistening denizens, assimilating into their underwater world. In “Goldfish” and “Goldfish 2” candles and sparklers glow even though submerged. Ms Choi says these compositions “capture the surreal moments in everyday life”. </p><div ><figure><div itemscope="" itemProp="image" itemType="https://schema.org/ImageObject" data-slim="1"><meta itemProp="url" content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/765/90/sites/default/files/images/2021/02/blogs/prospero/20210227_bkp505.jpg"/><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/765/90/sites/default/files/images/2021/02/blogs/prospero/20210227_bkp505.jpg"  sizes="300px" alt=""/></div></figure><p >Elements of the fantastic are also present in the cartoonish smiles and watchful eyes of some of Ms Choi’s fish. She does not keep the animals as models in her studio in east London, working from memory or her imagination instead; their anthropomorphic charm is born of a nostalgia for the talking creatures she encountered in fairy-tales as a youngster. Often this style has a poignant effect. The fish in “Aquarium”, “Bath” and “Fish Tank” look out from their narrow enclosures. Rather than transporting the viewer to a dreamy, aquatic other-world, these paintings highlight the constrictive practice of keeping fish as decorative objects.</p><p >Though Ms Choi began painting the animals more frequently in 2020, it was not a conscious reflection of the pandemic. Yet lockdown changed the way her art was viewed and, with it, her relationship to her subject matter. A friend printed “Aquarium” onto a New Year’s postcard with the message: “After the aquarium of 2020, back to the ocean of friendship in 2021!” During a two-week quarantine on a recent trip home to South Korea, Ms Choi realised she’d had enough. “I started to feel suffocated by the fish tanks I’m painting,” she says. “For now, I’d rather paint fish in open water instead.” </p><p ><em>Minyoung Choi’s paintings will be on display at the bo.lee gallery in London between March 16th and 22nd</em></p></div>
