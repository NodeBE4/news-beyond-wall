But they will also cast their gaze farther into the future, unveiling a detailed plan for the next five years, and a vaguer one for development until 2035. China has travelled far from its command-economy roots, but its policy-planning system, an inheritance from the Soviet Union, is a potent vestige. This will be the Communist Party’s 14th five-year plan for China. Running until 2025, it will feature targets for economic growth and objectives such as making the country greener, more innovative and safer from foreign pressure. What exactly are China’s five-year plans and what can we expect from the new one?</p><p >In the era of Mao Zedong, China’s five-year plans were strictly implemented. The Communist Party set production quotas—for instance, for steel and grain—that work units had to meet. This central direction and, often, misdirection squandered resources, leaving much of the country impoverished. In the 1980s, as the party loosened its grip on the economy, it also became more relaxed about the five-year plans. Rather than rigid agendas, they became more like manifestos for how the party wanted to steer the country. Yet these manifestos still pack a punch. Local officials, banks and big companies, whether owned by the state or not, adjust their strategies and their rhetoric to be in line with the plans.</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p >Five-year plans are no longer purely about economic production. Much space is also given to issues such as education and environmental protection. The newest plan is expected to provide details about how China intends to fulfil its pledge to cap carbon emissions by 2030 and achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2060. Officials have previously forecast that electric and hybrid vehicles will account for 20% of new car sales by 2025, up from about 5% today; they may use the new plan to make that a hard target. China is also expected to declare that it wants coal to account for 52% of its energy supply by 2025, down from nearly 58% now. Stronger action is needed to end the rise of <a href="https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2021/02/27/can-chinas-new-carbon-market-take-off">China’s carbon emissions</a>, but that would be an important step in the right direction.</p><p >The element of the five-year plans that tends to attract the most attention is the growth-rate target. In the past targets were set below the expected rate of GDP expansion, making them functionally irrelevant. But during the most recent plan (2016-20), China aimed for about 6.5% annual growth. It fell just short, mainly because of <a href="https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2021/01/18/chinas-economy-zooms-back-to-its-pre-covid-growth-rate">the slowdown</a> caused by the covid-19 pandemic. The new plan may return to setting a more conservative target, perhaps 5% or so. Investors, corporate bosses and officials alike will also be looking for clues about the meaning of the “dual circulation strategy” first <a href="https://www.economist.com/china/2020/11/05/chinas-dual-circulation-strategy-means-relying-less-on-foreigners">introduced by President Xi Jinping</a> last year. The idea, as far as most understand it, is to reduce China’s dependence on global markets (international circulation) and instead build up its capacity to produce what it wants and needs for itself (domestic circulation). China has come a long way since the Maoist era, but the desire for self-reliance echoes through the decades.</p><br><hr><div>获取更多RSS：<br><a href="https://feedx.net" style="color:orange" target="_blank">https://feedx.net</a> <br><a href="https://feedx.top" style="color:orange" target="_blank">https://feedx.top</a><br></div>
