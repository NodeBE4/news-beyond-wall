Romantic comedies are particularly popular with local audiences: “The Wedding Party” (2016) and “The Wedding Party 2” (2017) are the highest-grossing films to date. But, in a country where same-sex romances are banned, such movies have focused exclusively on heterosexual relationships for fear of falling foul of the National Film and Video Censors Board (NFVCB). “Ife”—which means “love” in Yoruba—is the first one to depict a lesbian couple.</p><p >It tells the story of a first date, with all the usual rom-com clichés: the nervous jitters, the glugging of red wine, the shy flirtation. Poetry readings give way to ludicrous declarations of love. What is unusual is the date’s location (Ife’s house) and its three-day duration. The pair cannot get to know each other in a restaurant or a bar, for to be lesbian in Nigeria is to remain hidden. </p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p >Though the characters discuss the difficulties of being gay—Ife is “out to everyone” but Adaora cannot come out because she is afraid of her family’s reaction—the film does not directly address the government’s anti-gay policies. Pamela Adie, the producer, sought to make a movie with “universal themes” that all Nigerians could relate to: young love, the weight of traditions and wanting to make your parents proud. </p><p >Nigeria is one of the least tolerant countries in the world on this issue, with 91% of respondents telling <a href="https://www.economist.comhttps://www.pewresearch.org/global/2020/06/25/global-divide-on-homosexuality-persists/">a recent Pew poll</a> that society should not accept homosexuality. Six years ago Goodluck Jonathan, then president, signed the Same-Sex Marriage Prohibition Act into law. Gay sex was already illegal throughout Nigeria, and in theory punishable by death in some states. The new law added ten-year jail terms for public displays of same-sex affection. Vigilante groups took it as encouragement to persecute gay and lesbian people. Coming out is now even more daunting than it was before.</p><p >Film-makers in other countries have been censored or targeted for making films depicting gay relationships. The cast of “Inxeba” (2017), a South African film which showed a relationship between two Xhosa men, had to go into hiding after threats of violence (though South African law is admirably pro-gay equality). “Rafiki” (2018) was banned for a time for its “clear intent to promote lesbianism in Kenya contrary to the law”. Making “Ife” similarly required bravery and resourcefulness. Ms Adie funded the film via The Equality Hub, an advocacy group she co-founded in 2017. She hired Uyaiedu Ikpe-Etim, a friend and fellow activist, to direct and assembled a cast and crew who shared her passion for the project and were willing to risk their reputations. (The casting call said: “Are you looking to star in a revolutionary role?”) The shoot took three days, mostly behind closed doors. “No one knew what [we] were doing,” Ms Adie says. </p><p >If the crew and cast have been able to remain safe, it is no thanks to the NFVCB, which has warned that the people involved in the making of “Ife” “will be tracked down”. Ms Adie circumvented the usual channels by not submitting the project to the NFVCB, knowing that it would be banned. The film will therefore not air on television; nor will it be granted a theatrical release in Nigeria. Instead, “Ife” will be made available to international viewers at select film festivals. The producer also plans to build a streaming platform on which the film will live after its festival run is over. The response on social media has been so positive, Ms Adie says, that her team has already started pre-production on a sequel. </p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p >The team behind “Ife” knows it isn’t alone. The film shows the cover of “She called me woman: Nigeria’s Queer Women Speak”, a book published in 2018, in its opening scene. Ms Adie hopes “Ife” will be the first of many films to tell the stories of gay Nigerian women. Her project is a blueprint for other film-makers in Nollywood who want to tackle taboo narratives away from the gaze of censors.</p>
