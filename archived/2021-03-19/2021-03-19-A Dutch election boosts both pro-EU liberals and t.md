The Netherlands has a proportional representation system with no minimum threshold (most <small>EU</small> countries have one at 5%), ensuring a large number of parties and a constant churn of new ones. Voters are more evenly divided than ever between them. The prime minister, Mark Rutte, a brilliant and imperturbably cheerful tactician, has nonetheless managed to stay atop the heap for ten years, through three ruling coalitions. Last year he was hit with the covid-19 pandemic and with a child-benefits scandal that forced his government to resign just two months before an election. Yet there was never much doubt that when the votes were counted, he and his centre-right Liberal (<small>VVD</small>) party would again come in first. Preliminary results after the ballot on March 17th showed that the <small>VVD</small> had won 23%, well ahead of any other party.</p><div ><figure ><figcaption>Listen to this story</figcaption><audio  controls="" id="audio-player" preload="none" src="https://www.economist.com/media-assets/audio/040%20Europe%20-%20Dutch%20election-7444e516f521607931565b746bea592d.mp3" title="A Dutch election boosts both pro-EU liberals and the far right" controlsList="nodownload"><p>Your browser does not support the &lt;audio&gt; element.</p></audio></figure><p >Enjoy more audio and podcasts on<!-- --> <a id="audio-ios-cta" href="https://www.economist.comhttps://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1239397626?pt=344884&amp;ct=article%20audio%20player&amp;mt=8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">iOS</a> <!-- -->or<!-- --> <a id="audio-android-cta" href="https://www.economist.comhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.economist.lamarr&amp;referrer=utm_source%3Darticle%2520audio%2520player" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Android</a>.</p></div><p >Second place, however, was a big surprise: <small>D</small>66, a left-leaning, liberal pro-European party. Its leader Sigrid Kaag, the current trade minister, is a former <small>UN</small> diplomat who presented herself as a candidate to become the Netherlands’ first female prime minister. <small>D</small>66 won 15%, one of the best results in its history. For his part, Mr Rutte moved towards the centre during the campaign, imitating left-wing parties’ rhetoric on social policy. And with the exception of the populist right, every party emphatically backed strong climate policies. For a country that spent last summer leading Europe’s “frugal” club of countries opposed to greater fiscal integration and nearly torpedoed the bloc’s €750bn ($900bn) covid-19 relief fund, the election may signal an important shift.</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p >Mr Rutte owes his victory partly to approval of his handling of covid-19. The Netherlands has not done very well—infection rates have been higher than in peers like Germany and Denmark, and track-and-trace and vaccination programmes have been slow. But most voters seemed not to mind, while others blamed the health minister, a Christian Democrat. During the campaign most of the opposition avoided the issue. As for the child-benefits scandal (in which the tax authority financially ruined thousands of parents over false accusations of fraud), it was not the <small>VVD</small> leader but the head of Labour who quit over his role in the affair.</p><p >Yet even for the teflon-coated Mr Rutte, forming a coalition will be difficult. Between 15 and 17 parties have made it into parliament, depending on the final count. Together, the <small>VVD</small>, <small>D66</small> and the Christian Democrats have exactly half the seats. But the Christian Democrats’ vote share fell to just 10%, from 13% in the previous election. Their leader, Wopke Hoekstra, currently finance minister, had been billed as a contender for Mr Rutte’s job but ran a clumsy campaign with no clear theme. They may prefer a spell in opposition to rebuild their strength, making Mr Rutte’s task harder.</p><p >The populist right split into more parties, but grew overall. The Party for Freedom (<small>PVV</small>), led by the anti-Muslim firebrand Geert Wilders, had hoped to finish second but settled for third with 11%. A smaller far-right party, Forum for Democracy, grew to 5%, while a new one, <small>JA21</small>, won 2%. All are considered untouchable by the major parties. On the left, Labour, the GreenLeft party and the far-left Socialists were pummelled, each winning 5-6%. Mr Rutte is unlikely to want more than one of them in his cabinet.</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p >That leaves the great swirl of small-to-tiny Dutch parties. They often forecast trends that take longer to materialise in other countries. Four years ago the arrival of Forum for Democracy seemed to augur a new wave of alt-right populism, but that party fractured in November over racism and anti-semitism. The Party for the Animals, the world’s first animal-rights party to win parliamentary representation, got 4%. Identity politics is going strong: <small>DENK</small>, a party representing Dutch Muslims, won 2%. Meanwhile Volt, a new pan-European liberal party that runs in every country in the <small>EU</small>, rose in the polls in the final weeks of the campaign and won 2%.</p><p >The <small>VVD</small>’s turn to the centre and the success of <small>D</small>66 suggest the next Dutch government may be a tad less parsimonious in future <small>EU</small> fiscal debates. But much depends on which parties join the coalition. In 2017 forming a government took over six months. Mr Rutte says the covid-19 crisis requires more urgent action, and wants speedy negotiations with <small>D66</small> and the Christian Democrats. But Ms Kaag wants to bring in more parties on the left. She will be happy to take her time. <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p><p data-test-id="Footnote" >This article appeared in the Europe section of the print edition under the headline &quot;Suddenly Sigrid&quot;</p>
