It had been months since he’d been diagnosed with cancer. By the time we visited for Christmas he was receiving only palliative treatment and it was understood that we were coming home for the end. Our daughter was about seven months old at the time. I remember my wife saying that one of the saddest things was that he would never get to see her as a toddler or a pre-schooler, let alone a teenager or young adult. He would only ever know her as this tiny thing, with her huge and astonished eyes, and her soft legs bicycle-kicking.</p><p >I’ve been thinking about this so much these past few weeks, probably, like everything else now, because of the pandemic. The problems that my family and I have faced are minor in the scheme of things. My livelihood hasn’t been much affected and no one close to me has contracted the virus. (“Can’t complain, I suppose,” I say to people I’m complaining to.) But the experience of this crisis has nevertheless been one of living in reduced circumstances. And that, for us, has included any meaningful contact with our broader family.</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p >Our children have three remaining grandparents, whom they have seen very little of this year. We live less than two hours away from my own parents, but we may as well have moved to New Zealand for all the time we’ve spent together since March: one trip to see them in July, a few days’ holiday in County Kerry over the summer.</p><figure data-image-nozoom="true"><div itemscope="" itemProp="image" itemType="https://schema.org/ImageObject"><meta itemProp="url" content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/1284/90/1843magazine.com/sites/default/files/20201126_ParentingSeperation-Image-2.jpg"/><img loading="lazy" width="1280" height="1284" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/1284/90/1843magazine.com/sites/default/files/20201126_ParentingSeperation-Image-2.jpg"  sizes="(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw" alt=""/></div></figure><p >A couple of weeks ago I spoke to my father on the phone. He said that he didn’t mind not being able to see me because he knew that, when we did finally get to be together again, I’d be basically unchanged from when he’d seen me last. The grandchildren, though, were a different story. Given the speed with which small children cycle through stages of development, distinct phases of their lives were passing in his absence.</p><blockquote><p>One of the saddest things was that her grandfather would never get to see her as a toddler or a pre-schooler, let alone a teenager or young adult</p></blockquote><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p >It was almost too sad to think about – which is why, I suppose, I’ve spent so much time thinking about it. For the first few months of the pandemic not being able to see my parents seemed like a minor inconvenience. I am lax about going to see them at the best of times, and months can easily lapse between visits. It was unfortunate that we couldn’t be together, and I felt bad that they couldn’t be around the kids. But I knew that they were safe, and that they were happy in one another’s company, so I didn’t let it get to me.</p><p >Now we are eight months into this thing we have long since exceeded the duration of any normal interlude of separation. And I have observed that I’ve begun to mediate my experience of my children through the fact of my parents’ distance from their lives. Any time I get a kick out of something they do, I’m shadowed by the realisation of what their grandparents are missing out on. It isn’t quite death we’re talking about here, but neither is it entirely unrelated.</p><figure data-image-nozoom="true"><div itemscope="" itemProp="image" itemType="https://schema.org/ImageObject"><meta itemProp="url" content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/1275/90/1843magazine.com/sites/default/files/20201126_ParentingSeperation-Image-3.jpg"/><img loading="lazy" width="1280" height="1275" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/1275/90/1843magazine.com/sites/default/files/20201126_ParentingSeperation-Image-3.jpg"  sizes="(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw" alt=""/></div></figure><p ><span data-caps="initial">S</span>ix months is a long time in the life of a seven-year-old and even longer in the life of a two-year-old. Since the start of the pandemic, our son has lost three baby teeth and gained permanent ones to replace them. His features have visibly changed, taking on a gentle definition that seems to presage the face he will have as an adult. All of a sudden, he has become a child who takes piano lessons and goes to football practice on Saturday mornings.</p><p >He has become obsessed with making puns and jokes, in a way that is both charming and exasperating. This morning I told him it was time to get up and he agreed that it was time we got “Up” – the Pixar film “Up”, that is, which it was high time we bought on <small>DVD</small>. It was the first pun of the day, and by God it would not be the last.</p><blockquote><p>It was almost too sad to think about – which is why, I suppose, I’ve spent so much time thinking about it</p></blockquote><p >And as for his little sister – so much has changed! Her hair, which has always been babyishly thin, is finally long and thick enough to curl around below her ears. With every passing week she becomes exponentially more articulate and gregarious. The other afternoon when we were waiting at a pedestrian crossing, she introduced herself to a mother and toddler on the footpath next to us, and then proceeded to introduce each of us by name. “And this is my daddy,” she said, gesturing expansively towards me from her buggy. “He is called Mark.”</p><p >The knowledge that children are perpetually passing through themselves on the way to becoming someone else is part of the delight and fascination of parenthood. Their behaviours and traits are in a state of constant evolution, so that the very things that once seemed to define them are always slipping into the past and passing out of memory. All this is just a basic premise of being alive. But it’s also devastating when you think about it. Not quite death, but not quite unrelated either.</p><figure data-image-nozoom="true"><div itemscope="" itemProp="image" itemType="https://schema.org/ImageObject"><meta itemProp="url" content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/1275/90/1843magazine.com/sites/default/files/20201126_ParentingSeperation-Image-4.jpg"/><img loading="lazy" width="1280" height="1275" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/1275/90/1843magazine.com/sites/default/files/20201126_ParentingSeperation-Image-4.jpg"  sizes="(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw" alt=""/></div></figure><p ><span data-caps="initial">D</span>o people love their grandchildren less than their children? It seems hard to imagine that they do, but just as hard to imagine that they don’t. Perhaps it’s a questionable distinction to begin with. In fact, being a grandparent may be a continuation of parenthood, or a reinvigoration of its essential dynamics, after an interlude of stasis.</p><blockquote><p>I am shadowed by the realisation of what their grandparents are missing out on: not quite death, but not entirely unrelated</p></blockquote><p >Even the most loving and healthy parent-child relationship reaches a plateau at a certain point. Most of what you’re going to know about your child – about who they are, existentially speaking, as opposed to the contingent facts of their everyday life – you will presumably have learned by the time they turn, say, 30. But then grandchildren come along and the old regime of learning and changing and growing is immediately reinstated.</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-3"></div></div></div><p >As far as I can tell, a grandparent’s love for their grandchild is also an extrapolation of their love for their child – which makes being a grandparent another way of being a parent. Seeing my parents with my children reawakens within me feelings of being a small child – crucially, of being the child of these particular parents. When I stand back and watch the way my dad interacts with my son, for instance – the antic silliness, the anxious tenderness, the use of language for comic ends – I am seeing, at a remove, what he was like with me.</p><p >That helps clarify for me the kind of parent, even the kind of person, that I am or aspire to be. It brings me closer to my own childhood, closer to my son, to my father and, in some strange way, to myself. I think this was a large part of why I was so sad, as my father-in-law neared death, to think of all he would miss out on. It wasn’t only, or even primarily, about him. Once you’re a parent, you’re never finished being a parent. Neither are you ever quite finished being a child.<span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p><p >ILLUSTRATIONS: <strong>KLAUS KREMMERZ</strong></p><br><hr><div>获取更多RSS：<br><a href="https://feedx.net" style="color:orange" target="_blank">https://feedx.net</a> <br><a href="https://feedx.xyz" style="color:orange" target="_blank">https://feedx.xyz</a><br></div>
