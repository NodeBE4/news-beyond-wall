Unfortunately, the total number of fatalities caused by the pandemic may be even higher, for several reasons. First, the official statistics in many countries exclude victims who did not test positive for coronavirus before dying—which can be a substantial majority in places with little capacity for testing. Second, hospitals and civil registries may not process death certificates for several days, or even weeks, which creates lags in the data. And third, the pandemic has made it harder for doctors to treat other conditions and discouraged people from going to hospital, which may have indirectly caused an increase in fatalities from diseases other than covid-19.</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p >One way to account for these methodological problems is to use a simpler measure, known as “excess deaths”: take the number of people who die from any cause in a given region and period, and then compare it with a historical baseline from recent years. We have used statistical models to create our baselines, by predicting the number of deaths each region would normally have recorded in 2020.</p><p >Many Western countries, and a handful of nations and regions elsewhere, regularly publish data on deaths from all causes. The table below shows that, in most places, the number of excess deaths (compared with our baseline) is greater than the number of covid-19 fatalities officially recorded by the government.</p><figure><iframe height="NaN" src="https://infographics.economist.com/2020/covid-19-excess-mortality-interactive/table.html" data-size="full-width"></iframe></figure><p >The chart below uses data from <a href="https://www.economist.comhttps://www.euromomo.eu/">EuroMOMO</a>, a network of epidemiologists who collect weekly reports on deaths from all causes in 23 European countries. These figures show that, compared with a historical baseline of the previous five years, Europe has suffered some deadly flu seasons since 2016—but that the death toll this year from covid-19 is far greater. Though most of those victims have been older than 65, the number of deaths among Europeans aged 45-64 was 40% higher than usual in early April.</p><figure><iframe height="NaN" src="https://infographics.economist.com/2020/covid-19-excess-mortality-interactive/heatmap-euromomo.html" data-size="full-width"></iframe></figure><p >For some of the countries that publish data on excess deaths, we have been able to break the numbers down by region. The chart below allows you to explore these regional trends. The full data for each country and region, as well as our underlying code, can be downloaded from our <a href="https://www.economist.comhttps://github.com/TheEconomist/covid-19-excess-deaths-tracker">GitHub repository</a>. Our sources also include the <a href="https://www.economist.comhttps://www.mortality.org/">Human Mortality Database</a>, a collaboration between UC Berkeley and the Max Planck Institute in Germany, and the <a href="https://www.economist.comhttps://github.com/akarlinsky/world_mortality">World Mortality Dataset</a>, created by Ariel Karlinsky and Dmitry Kobak.</p><figure><iframe height="NaN" src="https://infographics.economist.com/2020/covid-19-excess-mortality-interactive/heatmap-regions.html" data-size="full-width"></iframe></figure><p >Below are a second set of charts, comparing the number of excess deaths and official covid-19 deaths over time in each country. The lines on each chart represent excess deaths, and the shaded area represents the number of fatalities officially attributed to coronavirus by the government.</p><figure><iframe height="NaN" src="https://infographics.economist.com/2020/covid-19-excess-mortality-interactive-explainer/index.html" data-size="full-width"></iframe></figure><p >In March and April, as big cities on America’s east coast were hit hard by the pandemic, most other states locked down quickly enough to prevent major outbreaks. But throughout the rest of 2020, mortality has remained above its usual rate across much of the country. Some parts of the Midwest suffered large spikes in death rates during November and December, after experiencing few fatalities during the first wave.</p><figure><iframe height="NaN" src="https://infographics.economist.com/2020/covid-19-excess-mortality-interactive/line-expected-deaths-us.html" data-size="full-width"></iframe></figure><p >At the same time that covid-19 was devastating New York, cities in western Europe were also suffering severe outbreaks. Britain, Spain, Italy and Belgium have some of the highest national excess-death rates in the world, after adjusting for the size of their populations. France and Portugal locked down comparatively early, given the number of positive tests at the time. However, a second wave of covid-19 in winter has caused excess mortality to rise again across the region. (Some countries also recorded a small spike of non-covid fatalities during a heat wave in August.) </p><figure><iframe height="NaN" src="https://infographics.economist.com/2020/covid-19-excess-mortality-interactive/line-expected-deaths.html?countries=belgium;britain;spain;portugal;italy;france" data-size="full-width"></iframe></figure><p >Countries in northern Europe have generally experienced much lower mortality rates. Some Nordic nations have experienced almost no excess deaths at all. The exception is Sweden, which imposed some of the continent’s least restrictive social-distancing measures during the first wave.</p><figure><iframe height="NaN" src="https://infographics.economist.com/2020/covid-19-excess-mortality-interactive/line-expected-deaths.html?countries=sweden;estonia;denmark;finland;norway;iceland" data-size="full-width"></iframe></figure><p >In central Europe only the Netherlands and Switzerland suffered large numbers of excess deaths in the first wave. Most other countries shut their borders in time to stop the virus spreading much. After international travel resumed in the summer of 2020, the entire region was hit hard by the second wave in the autumn.</p><figure><iframe height="NaN" src="https://infographics.economist.com/2020/covid-19-excess-mortality-interactive/line-expected-deaths.html?countries=poland;czech-republic;slovenia;hungary;netherlands;austria;switzerland;germany;slovakia;luxembourg" data-size="full-width"></iframe></figure><p >November and December proved particularly lethal in south-eastern Europe. Bulgaria recorded the highest weekly excess-mortality rates of any country in our tracker, with several other Balkan nations experiencing spikes in covid-19 deaths.</p><figure><iframe height="NaN" src="https://infographics.economist.com/2020/covid-19-excess-mortality-interactive/line-expected-deaths.html?countries=bulgaria;serbia;north-macedonia;romania;kosovo;croatia;bosnia-and-herzegovina;albania;malta;greece;montenegro" data-size="full-width"></iframe></figure><p >Among former republics of the Soviet Union, only Belarus suffered substantial excess mortality in the first wave, after introducing almost no constraints on daily life. The second wave affected almost every country in the region. Russia now has one of the world’s largest excess-mortality gaps. It recorded about 370,000 more deaths than expected between April and December, compared with an official covid-19 toll of only 56,000.</p><figure><iframe height="NaN" src="https://infographics.economist.com/2020/covid-19-excess-mortality-interactive/line-expected-deaths.html?countries=russia;lithuania;moldova;kyrgyzstan;latvia;ukraine;belarus;uzbekistan;georgia" data-size="full-width"></iframe></figure><p >Latin America experienced its worst period from April to July, particularly in Bolivia and Ecuador. Though most of these countries managed to reduce excess-mortality rates as 2020 wore on, the number of deaths remained higher than usual across the continent.</p><figure><iframe height="NaN" src="https://infographics.economist.com/2020/covid-19-excess-mortality-interactive/line-expected-deaths.html?countries=peru;mexico;bolivia;ecuador;brazil;chile;colombia;costa-rica" data-size="full-width"></iframe></figure><p >Outside Europe and the Americas, few places release data about excess deaths. No such information exists for large swathes of Africa and Asia, where some countries issue death certificates for a small fraction of people. Among developing countries that do produce regular mortality statistics, South Africa shows the grimmest picture. It recorded a huge spike in fatalities in January, as a more transmissible variant of the virus spread through the country. In contrast, Thailand and the Philippines both had “negative” excess mortality—fewer deaths than they would have recorded in a normal year, perhaps because of social distancing.</p><figure><iframe height="NaN" src="https://infographics.economist.com/2020/covid-19-excess-mortality-interactive/line-expected-deaths.html?countries=south-africa;egypt;oman;thailand;philippines;mongolia" data-size="full-width"></iframe></figure><p >A handful of rich countries elsewhere publish regular mortality data. They tend to have negative excess mortality. Australia and New Zealand managed to eradicate local transmission after severe lockdowns. Taiwan and South Korea achieved the same outcome through highly effective contact-tracing systems. Israel has experienced some excess deaths, but has also outpaced the rest of the world in vaccinating its population, with promising results.</p><figure><iframe height="NaN" src="https://infographics.economist.com/2020/covid-19-excess-mortality-interactive/line-expected-deaths.html?countries=israel;canada;qatar;cyprus;south-korea;singapore;japan;australia;taiwan;new-zealand" data-size="full-width"></iframe></figure><p ><i><b>Update (October 14th 2020):</b> A previous version of this page used a five-year average of deaths in a given region to calculate a baseline for excess deaths. The page now uses a statistical model for each region, which predicts the number of deaths we might normally have expected in 2020. The model fits a linear trend to years, to adjust from long-term increases or decreases in deaths, and a fixed effect for each week or month.</i></p><p ><i><b>Correction:</b> The data for deaths officially attributed to covid-19 in Chile were corrected on September 9th 2020.
