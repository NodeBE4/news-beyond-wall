Tiny in comparison with Nelson’s Column, and often obscured by passing buses, the brass sculpture of a king on horseback is in fact one of the most divisive works of public art in British history. Though America still wrestles with the artistic (and political) legacy of its civil war, the arguments that once raged in Britain about the “Equestrian Statue of Charles I” (pictured) have quieted. In “Scenes and Traces of the English Civil War” Stephen Bann, an art historian, dredges up those old discordances and, in so doing, expects to shed a little light on the country’s “contemporary political divisions”.</p><p >The statue of Charles was first cast by a French artist in 1633—almost a decade before the start of the English civil war—but the monument did not go on public display in London until 1675. In the intervening years, Charles plunged his kingdoms into conflict, eventually losing both the war and his own head after Parliament tried and executed him for treason. A short-lived republic was established under Oliver Cromwell until, after some experiments in government-without-monarchy, Charles’s son reclaimed the throne in 1660. </p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p >Deep polarisation, combined with powerful new weaponry including muskets, had made the civil war period the most deadly in British history: a higher proportion of the population died from fighting, famine and disease than in any of the country’s other conflicts. It is little surprise, then, that the statue of Charles, who was perceived by many as the prime agent of the war, caused some controversy. Edmund Waller, a poet, thought the statue’s purpose was “that mortals may eternally be taught,/Rebellion, though successful, is but vain,/And kings so kill’d rise conquerors again”.</p><p >Although it is the most famous of the civil war monuments, many others sprung up in the decades (and indeed the centuries) after the war’s end. Some were intended as simple memorials to the fallen, but most served as political statements about religion, government and the role of blue-bloods in society. These debates rolled on into the 20th century and, as Mr Bann shows, such art was a useful tool for both sides.</p><p >In the immediate post-war years, when Cromwell and the Parliamentarians ruled, their monuments were pre-eminent. Then with the ultimate victory of the Royalists, much of the public art that proliferated in later decades honoured the cause of King Charles. It helped that artistic patrons were invariably rich and often aristocratic, since they had little sympathy for the defeated king-killers. This one-sidedness in art, based on who was in power, had an interesting side-effect: vandalism. Defacing and damaging the opponents’ monuments became a popular method of dissent and, in Mr Bann’s view, a form of artistic expression: while toppling statues is a fairly modern innovation, covering them in graffiti is not. Mr Bann categorises “the surviving marks of iconoclasm and vandalism” as part of art history.</p><p >Some of Royalism’s opponents found more constructive ways to object. Mr Bann homes in on Bristol, where another equestrian statue was built to rival the effigy in Trafalgar Square. In the 1700s local leaders in Bristol orchestrated a pointed rebuke of Charles’s memory by erecting a monument to King William III, a reformer who became king after the Glorious Revolution of 1688 and ushered in true parliamentary government. This statue’s political influence endured: a century later, in the “Bristol Riots” of 1831, those protesting for fair representation and the right to vote gathered around William’s statue, with its inscription to “our Great and Glorious Deliverer”. Though Bristol’s choice of statuary came under scrutiny in 2020, when a monument to the slave-trader Edward Colston was brought down by another group of demonstrators, this episode shows a more positive tradition of public art’s political uses.</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p >“Scenes and Traces of the English Civil War” concludes with the Victorian period, when a culture of reform made artists, patrons and politicians think again about the conflict. Members of the Liberal party embraced the legacy of the parliamentarians and in 1899, perhaps taking a lesson from their Bristolian forefathers, had a statue of Cromwell erected outside the House of Commons. Two and a half centuries after the fighting ended, this decision still provoked widespread public debate, newspaper campaigns and a vote in the House of Commons (the Liberals won by only a slight margin). </p><p >Though Mr Bann finishes the book in the 19th century, Britain’s civil war statues again made headlines in June of this year. After a series of graffiti incidents, and a new campaign in Ireland to have it removed (on the grounds that the Cromwellian conquest was an act of genocide), Boris Johnson felt compelled to defend Cromwell’s statue, among others, arguing that to “tear them down would be to lie about our history”. Sectarian tensions may have cooled over the centuries, but civil war art still excites passion in Britain.</p><p ><strong>Scenes and Traces of the English Civil War.</strong> By Stephen Bann.<em> Reaktion Books; 288 pages; £40</em></p>
