In the weeks leading up to the elections on November 3rd, polls showed that many of the fault lines dividing Democrats and Republicans—including age, race and education—were beginning to narrow. Even the gap between city-dwellers and rural folk seemed to be shrinking. According to a poll conducted by YouGov between October 31st and November 2nd, voters in rural areas favoured President Donald Trump over Joe Biden, his Democratic opponent, by a margin of ten percentage points. Four years ago, this gap was 20 points.</p><p >But an analysis by <em>The Economist</em> suggests that the partisan divide between America’s dense cities and sparsely populated places is greater than ever. Preliminary election results supplied by Decision Desk HQ, a data-provider, show that voters in the least urbanised counties voted for Mr Trump by a margin of 35 points, up from 32 points in 2016. (Specifically these are the bottom 20% of counties by population density. Counties with more than 10% Hispanics, who shifted to the right for reasons unrelated to density, have been excluded.) Meanwhile, voters in the most urbanised counties—the top 20%—plumped for Mr Biden by 29 points, up from Hillary Clinton’s 25-point margin in 2016. More broadly, the greater the population density, the bigger the swing to the Democratic candidate (see chart). Even after controlling for other relevant demographic factors, such as the proportion of whites without college degrees or Hispanics in each county, the data suggest that urban and rural voters are more divided today than they were in 2016.</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p >Of course, geographic polarisation in America is nothing new. The preliminary results from this year’s race also show that Mr Biden gained most ground in counties that swung hardest toward Democrats between Barack Obama’s re-election in 2012 and Hillary Clinton’s failed bid for the White House in 2016. One possible explanation for this trend is the tendency for Democrats and Republicans to live among their own kind. Americans are increasingly sorting themselves into politically like-minded communities. For liberals, this means diverse, densely-populated cities; for conservatives it is places that are mostly white, working-class and sparse.</p><p >Such sorting has consequences for elections. Because seats in the House of Representatives and the Senate and votes in the electoral college that chooses the president are awarded on a winner-take-all basis, rather than in proportion to the popular vote, they can end up under-representing voters for one party who are crammed into just a few states or congressional districts. As Democrats increasingly cluster in cities, the system could reduce their political clout.</p><p >In this year’s election, for example, Mr Biden will win the national popular vote by about five percentage points. But his margin in the “tipping-point” state that ultimately decided the election, Wisconsin, will be less than one point. That four-point advantage for the Republicans is the biggest in at least four decades. So long as Democrats continue to be the party of the cities, and Republicans the party of small-town and rural America, those biases will persist.</p>
