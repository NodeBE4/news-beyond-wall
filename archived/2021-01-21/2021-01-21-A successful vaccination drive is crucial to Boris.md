Today, a scarcely less miraculous scene is unfolding. A trickle of pensioners, bundled against the cold, leaning on sticks and walking frames, processes through the great arched doorways. Beneath a crucifix, around 700 a day are being vaccinated against covid-19. For some, it is their first journey outdoors since England’s lockdowns began in March, says the Very Rev Adrian Dorber, the dean. “This is quite a big act of faith for them to come.”</p><p >Britain’s covid-19 vaccination drive has had a strong start. Rugby grounds, village halls, theatres and a Sikh temple have been turned over to the most vital logistical effort since the second world war. By January 19th, 4.6m people had received the first of two doses of a vaccine against coronavirus, which places Britain fourth in the world for the percentage of people vaccinated. The government hopes to issue a first dose to all care-home residents, the clinically vulnerable and the over-70s—a group of around 15m people who account for nine in ten covid-19 deaths—by mid-February.</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p >The global vaccination drive will revive battered governments everywhere, but the size of the political dividend will vary from country to country. For Boris Johnson’s government, it could be particularly high. Britain’s death rate, of 129 deaths per 100,000 people, is the seventh-highest in the world, according to data compiled by <em>The Economist</em>. Some 1,820 covid-related deaths were reported on January 19th alone, the highest daily toll yet, and British hospitals remain under severe pressure.</p><p >Some of the blame lies with the government, which was slow to appreciate the threat from covid-19, to impose lockdowns and to procure protective equipment for health workers. A plan to allow families to gather for Christmas was cancelled in southern England with six days’ notice. Conservative <small>MP</small>s grew tired of defending policies which were quickly abandoned, and doubted Mr Johnson’s fitness for office. Sir Keir Starmer, the sure-footed Labour leader, looked a credible rival.</p><p >Tories hope that the vaccination drive may restore faith in Mr Johnson’s premiership. The programme has benefited from far-sighted planning missing elsewhere in the government’s response: the task-force for funding and procuring vaccines was set up last April, and the <small>NHS</small> spent the autumn drafting delivery plans. It has relied on tested networks of family doctors, rather than the Silicon Valley-inspired “moonshots” favoured by Dominic Cummings, Mr Johnson’s former aide. A poll by Opinium released on January 16th found 47% of voters approve of the government’s handling of the vaccine and 23% disapprove; for the pandemic as a whole, the figures are 30% to 51%. “Having had so many stoppy-starty things that didn’t work, it’s rather disorientating to have something go so well,” says an influential Conservative.</p><p >A successful vaccine programme would also deflate the Conservative Party’s lockdown rebels, who grew more numerous as Britain’s restrictions dragged into the winter. The case against lockdowns rested on the fear that no vaccine would be found soon and Britain would have to learn to “live with the virus” as mass immunity slowly developed. That case has disintegrated: in Britain last week six people were jabbed for every new case of coronavirus detected. Mr Johnson’s plea for sceptics to hold firm until the “cavalry” arrived has been vindicated, a rebel concedes.</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p >For many Tory <small>MP</small>s, the vaccine has the pleasant side-effect of reinforcing their political convictions. One is Brexit. The vaccine offers an intellectual coherence to a project that looked increasingly chaotic and eccentric after four years of negotiations. Britain is outperforming its neighbours: it had issued 7 doses per 100 people by January 18th, the highest rate in Europe, compared to 2 in Italy, 1.5 in Germany and 0.7 in France. The gap is largely due to Britain’s decision to opt out of the <small>EU</small>’s programme of vaccine procurement and to offer emergency authorisation ahead of the European regulator. This has allowed Britain to buy more jabs and to dish them out before the <small>EU</small>. Both would have been legal while Britain was in the union, but Brexit made it politically easier.</p><p >To Brexiteers, it is proof of Vote Leave’s claim that agility would be more valuable than membership of a huge market. “I’ve always said it would be like a ball and chain being released from the ankles of Britain,” says Michael Fabricant, the <small>MP</small> for Lichfield. More cautious <small>MP</small>s who feared the <small>MHRA</small> would stumble outside the <small>EU</small>’s ecosystem feel reassured. Mr Johnson would like Britain to be known for scientific research after Brexit; the AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine is a helpful calling card.</p><p >The second happy side-effect is on the union. For six months, polls have shown a clear margin of support for Scottish independence. Since health policy is its responsibility, the Scottish government has taken day-to-day charge of the emergency, making it look less like a town council and more like a state-in-waiting. With Mr Johnson and Brexit unpopular, the <small>UK</small> government has struggled to make the case for the union. But it reckons the vaccine, which it procured on behalf of the entire union, provides proof of the “power of the union” and of the risks for Scots of breaking away.</p><p >Yet the vaccination programme is politically vulnerable. Its coverage is patchy, with some regions ahead of others. Supplies of the vaccine are tight. Well-placed observers expect meeting the mid-February target to be a close-run thing. “If they can get the sixth dose out of every vial from now on they should be <small>OK</small>,” reckons one. And vaccines may prove less effective against new variants of the disease.</p><p >Even if the mid-February target is met, Mr Johnson will face a fight with his party over how quickly to unwind the current lockdown. His office says the pace will be dictated by the flow of new cases and the burden on hospitals, but many <small>MP</small>s want to see restrictions loosened quickly, warning that shuttered bars and shops are preventing a generation from getting into the workforce. Some are already protesting about the risk of restrictions next winter if it brings another wave of the virus. They are also keen that local and mayoral elections scheduled for May should go ahead.</p><p >There are tussles within the party over money, too. Conservatives are divided on how to withdraw aid to stricken firms and families. New <small>MP</small>s from poorer seats are unhappy over the scheduled withdrawal of a weekly welfare top-up of £20 ($27). Still, a successful vaccine programme will be the shot in the arm Mr Johnson’s administration needs, says an <small>MP</small>. “We can look constituents in the eye and say, this man got us where we need to be.” <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p><p data-test-id="Footnote" >This article appeared in the Britain section of the print edition under the headline &quot;Restoring the faith&quot;</p>
