The killing of George Floyd, an African-American man, by Derek Chauvin, a Minneapolis policeman, in May set off a wave of protests across the United States. It has also sparked a powerful response in the American theatre.</p><p >Two theatre professionals issued a call for minority actors and troupes across the country to create monologues and performances exactly eight minutes, 46 seconds long—the length of time that Mr Chauvin pressed his knee into Floyd’s neck. Gamal Abdel Chasten, a founder of the Universes Theatre Ensemble in New York, and Marieke Gaboury, a theatre specialist who works for the city of Palo Alto, call their endeavour The Breath Project in reference to Floyd’s final words: “I can’t breathe.” In three months they have received recordings of nearly 100 original works from performers and directors identifying as BIPOC (black, indigenous and people of colour), all now archived online for the public to see.</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p >There is a visceral intimacy to actors speaking directly to the viewer, sharing horrific experiences and expressing fears. In “Waiting for Death” James Brunt, an actor from Denver, emerges dripping from a pond before saying: “Killing black boys in this country is easy. I’d like to know exactly when I’m about to go.” In a piece titled “Just Breathe” (pictured top), the performers of the Ananya Dance Theatre of St Paul writhe in a transparent box that slowly fills with smoke. An actor from Flint, Michigan, who goes by Harvey, performs “Breonna’s Prayer”, creaming her face before bed like Breonna Taylor, the Kentucky woman shot to death in her home by police. In a voiceover, a woman chants: “Now I lay me down to sleep/I pray the Lord my soul to keep/Because I’ll die before I wake.”</p><p >There is rhyming and spoken word, song and dance and many-voiced ensemble work; there are mothers who mourn, men who express their fear of sudden death, a fictional cop who admits “for the first time I’m ashamed.” Nor is police violence against African-Americans the only theme. Climate change, gender and the coronavirus pandemic are part of this picture, too. The project aims to capture “this trying and abrasive moment in American history,” Mr Chasten says. Over time, the archive is meant to function as a living time capsule.</p><figure><div itemscope="" itemProp="image" itemType="https://schema.org/ImageObject" data-slim="0"><meta itemProp="url" content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/720/90/sites/default/files/20201031_BKP503.jpg"/><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/720/90/sites/default/files/20201031_BKP503.jpg"  sizes="(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw" alt=""/></div></figure><p >It has another big goal: by collaborating with two dozen regional theatres, all of which provided support to these performers, The Breath Project hopes to build a more equitable and inclusive American theatre. Opportunities for people of colour on and offstage remain limited in the United States. A study by Actors Equity, the industry union, in 2017 showed that African-Americans account for only about ten percent of principal roles on Broadway, and slightly more off-Broadway (according to the census of 2010, African-Americans make up 25% of New York City’s population). Wages are typically lower, and offstage, the picture is even worse. According to the newly formed Black Theatre Coalition, out of more than 11,000 shows since Broadway opened in 1866, only 38 directors, stage managers and choreographers have been black. </p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p >The Breath Project is one of several groups now working to address this imbalance. Its partner theatres from Cincinnati to New Orleans to Hawaii have pledged to stage some of these pieces when live theatre resumes, while the online archive can serve as a resource for artistic directors seeking to cast BIPOC actors in their productions.</p><p >“We’ve got to use this moment, if we truly want to diversify” theatre companies and audiences, Mr Chasten says. Out of crisis can come change. Though prevented from performing live, thespians are inventing new ways of staging. In “Transcending Isolation”, a Palo Alto youth group and Stanford University’s Compression Forum, a research and data institute, piece together the voices of teenagers from around the globe, communicating their loneliness over text and social media. “I want to believe that we’ll figure it out,” one says. It is a hope which The Breath Project shares.</p><p ><em>The Breath Project can be accessed at <a href="https://www.economist.comhttps://www.thebreathproject2020.com/">www.thebreathproject2020.com</a></em></p>
