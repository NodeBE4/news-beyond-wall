With whatever it has to hand. Sometimes, with the hand itself. The precise method is less important than the numbers. If a crowd can raise a salute or a wooden spoon or a plastic toy, this tells the authorities that other forms of resistance are also possible. Anything, it seems, can be freighted with rebellion: in 2014 police in Bangkok began arresting demonstrators who turned public sandwich-eating into an anti-authoritarian gesture (when protests were banned, pro-democracy activists took to holding sedate picnics instead).</p><p >In recent weeks, opponents of the military coup in Myanmar have developed their own symbols. Some have been seen pushing their thumbs and pinkies together to raise three fingers to the generals: a modern gesture that, carried by internet memes, has moved swiftly from the “Hunger Games” films to the streets of Asia, gathering meaning on the way. For Katniss Everdeen and the original fictional discontents of District 12, those three fingers meant overturning the dictatorship of Donald Sutherland’s silky villain. For the Filipino students who adopted the salute in their successful campaign to oust a corrupt college dean, they represented transparency, accountability and academic excellence.</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p >The Myanmar demonstrators don’t just use gestures: they come with noise and clamour, too. And this strategy has roots that go deeper than the young-adult fiction of the 1990s. The people standing on doorsteps and balconies making an anvil chorus with kitchen utensils are practising a Burmese tradition of dissent and exorcism. Cacophonous pots and pans drive evil from the home. In 1988 they were also used to drive out Sein Lwin, the 17-day president nicknamed the “butcher of Rangoon”.</p><p >The tactic has no particular political allegiance, though its associated vocabulary reveals the journey it has made. In 1971 anti-socialist demonstrators banged their kitchenware on the streets of Santiago to signal their opposition to Salvador Allende’s government in Chile, in what was known as <em>la marcha de las cacerolas vacías</em> (the “march of the empty pots”). In Venezuela in 1992, President Carlos Andrés Pérez found his ears ringing with the sound of the <em>cacerolazo</em>, a noisy protest against his economic reforms. That word – and its commotion – was exported in 2017 to Spain, where supporters of Catalan independence brought a nightly 15 minutes of disturbance to the air of Barcelona.</p><p >The same clatter of discontent now echoes around Yangon. In 1988 the army cut down demonstrators with live ammunition. Sadly, the generals are at it again. Mya Thwe Thwe Khaing was the first to be killed in the current protests, shot in the head just before her 20th birthday. The clash of cookware will not drown out the din of bullets.</p><figure data-image-nozoom="true"><div itemscope="" itemProp="image" itemType="https://schema.org/ImageObject"><meta itemProp="url" content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/1093/90/1843magazine.com/sites/default/files/1843_20210223_PROTESTSYMBOLS_002.jpg"/><img loading="lazy" width="1280" height="1093" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/1093/90/1843magazine.com/sites/default/files/1843_20210223_PROTESTSYMBOLS_002.jpg"  sizes="(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw" alt=""/></div></figure><p ><strong>Who’s counting?</strong> The peace sign <em>1960s</em><br/> The era of free love brought many kinds of promiscuity: count them on the fingers in this image. In 1968 Richard Nixon made the sign as a gesture of victory in the thick of an unwinnable campaign in Indochina. Anti-war activists turned the gesture back on him: it became the salute of a generation, used at sit-ins and die-ins and, sincerely and insincerely, in dealings between tuned-in, turned-on individuals.</p><p >Its energy came from a struggle won by their parents. Allied Europe adopted the 22nd letter of the alphabet as an anti-fascist sigil. The resistance chalked it on the walls and asphalt of occupied France and Belgium – it became so ubiquitous that the occupiers tried to adopt it for themselves. Winston Churchill brandished it most vehemently, sometimes with a cigar between his fingers.</p><p >It moved beyond the body into the airwaves, translated into Morse code by the <small>BBC</small> and dit-dit-dit-daa’d across the Continent in a pleasing echo of Beethoven’s Fifth Symphony. It had a role in the cold war, too, when it was raised on the streets of Poland during martial law and its democratic aftermath.</p><p >Where is it now? Part of the semi-instinctive body language of the selfie, along with puckered lips, sucked-in cheeks and the phone-arm raised to flatter the jawline. Thoroughly domesticated and demobbed, for the moment, from the field of human conflict.</p><figure data-image-nozoom="true"><div itemscope="" itemProp="image" itemType="https://schema.org/ImageObject"><meta itemProp="url" content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/1300/90/1843magazine.com/sites/default/files/1843_20210223_PROTESTSYMBOLS_003.jpg"/><img loading="lazy" width="1280" height="1300" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/1300/90/1843magazine.com/sites/default/files/1843_20210223_PROTESTSYMBOLS_003.jpg"  sizes="(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw" alt=""/></div></figure><p ><strong>Shot in the arm </strong>The Black Power fist <em>1971</em><br/> We remember Muhammad Ali, the anti-war activist. It’s down to that knockout soundbite – “No Viet Cong ever called me n----r” – and his presence at the 10,000-strong rally in June 1967 that helped convince LBJ not to run for a second term. His support for the Black Power movement has left less of a mark on the cultural memory, despite his close friendship with Stokeley Carmichael, a radical African-American activist, and Ali’s one-time belief in a separate state for black Americans.</p><p >Here’s the evidence of Ali’s views. That fist, raised as he enters the ring at Madison Square Garden in January 1971, was a gesture that African-Americans borrowed from anarchist protest in Europe. It signalled that the new phase of civil-rights politics would be less conciliatory and less God-fearing than the era of Martin Luther King. Which is why figures less powerful and self-sufficient than Ali risked so much to make it.</p><p >When American athletes John Carlos and Tommie Smith raised their fists at the 1968 Mexico Olympics, their stand killed their careers. The following year Dillibe Onyeama, Eton’s first black student, gave the Black Power salute in a school production of “Antony and Cleopatra”, and made the news. Writing about the experience got him banned from school premises. Last year, Eton offered a full apology and invited him to visit. Onyeama accepted – on condition that the school fly him in from Nigeria.</p><figure data-image-nozoom="true"><div itemscope="" itemProp="image" itemType="https://schema.org/ImageObject"><meta itemProp="url" content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/874/90/1843magazine.com/sites/default/files/1843_20210223_PROTESTSYMBOLS_004.jpg"/><img loading="lazy" width="1280" height="874" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/874/90/1843magazine.com/sites/default/files/1843_20210223_PROTESTSYMBOLS_004.jpg"  sizes="(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw" alt=""/></div></figure><p ><strong>Shape up </strong>Pink triangle, Atlanta, Georgia <em>1988</em><br/> Some signs have a polarity that can be reversed. A marker of oppression can become a symbol of resistance. It didn’t happen quickly with the pink triangle, partly because the badge itself, used by the Nazis to identify homosexual inmates of concentration camps, remained relatively obscure for so long.</p><p >During the Third Reich, between 5,000 and 15,000 men were made to stitch <em>die Rosa-Winkel</em> on their uniforms. In some camps that meant being obliged to provide sexual favours, in others it conferred guinea-pig status in experiments to discover a cure for typhus or homosexuality itself.</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p >Scholarship on this subject began to expand only in the 1970s and 1980s. Activists in Miami wore pink badges in 1977 to protest against the repeal of a law designed to protect gay people from discrimination in the housing market, and had to explain their significance to the press. At the beginning of the 1980s, Martin Sherman’s Broadway play “Bent” – based in part on academic research that no publisher wanted to touch – brought this history into the public conversation.</p><p >When <small>HIV</small> and <small>AIDS</small> entered that discourse William F. Buckley, a right-wing journalist, suggested tattooing the infected, and 2m Californians signed a petition to put patients into quarantine camps. Posters, <small>T</small>-shirts and enamel pins were emblazoned with the pink triangle to provide a reminder of the origin of such policies.</p><figure data-image-nozoom="true"><div itemscope="" itemProp="image" itemType="https://schema.org/ImageObject"><meta itemProp="url" content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/1115/90/1843magazine.com/sites/default/files/1843_20210223_PROTESTSYMBOLS_005.jpg"/><img loading="lazy" width="1280" height="1115" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/1115/90/1843magazine.com/sites/default/files/1843_20210223_PROTESTSYMBOLS_005.jpg"  sizes="(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw" alt=""/></div></figure><p ><strong>Sole mates </strong>Shoes, Pakistan <em>2008</em><br/> The first decade of this century – the years of 9/11 and the Iraq war – didn’t do much to deepen understanding between East and West. It did, however, transmit one piece of cultural knowledge westwards: the symbolic heft of the shoe.</p><p >For many, this intelligence arrived in April 2003 in the form of news footage that the American-led coalition celebrated as good <small>PR</small>. The 12-metre statue of Saddam Hussein in Firdos Square in Baghdad, which had been erected only the year before, was dragged down with chains by his former subjects. In their moment of triumph, the protesters pulled off their slip-ons and gave Ba’athism a symbolic beating.</p><p >Diplomats trained not to let their soles show in meetings would have understood the taboo. The sole of the shoe carries dirt. Show it or throw it at someone and you are transferring that dirt to them. A lesson was learned.</p><p >In December 2008 an Iraqi journalist called Muntazer al-Zaidi attended a press conference given by outgoing President George W. Bush. “This is a farewell kiss from the Iraqi people, dog,” he yelled, as he hurled his first size ten Bushwards. With the second he cried, “This is for the widows and orphans and all those killed in Iraq.”</p><p >These Pakistani activists, restaging the event with a prop fashioned from a stuffed shirt and a paper photocopy, are protesting against what happened next: al-Zaidi was tried on charges that carried up to 15 years in jail. Others produced more substantial responses. An Iraqi artist, Laith al-Amiri, erected a two-metre-high bronze-painted sculpture of a shoe and filled it with plastic flowers. Its location? Tikrit, where Saddam Hussein was born and buried.</p><figure data-image-nozoom="true"><div itemscope="" itemProp="image" itemType="https://schema.org/ImageObject"><meta itemProp="url" content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/850/90/1843magazine.com/sites/default/files/1843_20210223_PROTESTSYMBOLS_006.jpg"/><img loading="lazy" width="1280" height="850" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/850/90/1843magazine.com/sites/default/files/1843_20210223_PROTESTSYMBOLS_006.jpg"  sizes="(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw" alt=""/></div></figure><p ><strong>The grin reaper </strong>Guido mask, London <em>2011</em><br/> American comic books produced the Superman “S” and the Bat-signal: symbols of law, order and authority. British comic books, by contrast, created one of the world’s most popular symbols of anarchy.</p><p >Cartoonist David Lloyd first drew the smiling, blushing face of Guido Fawkes for “V for Vendetta”, a strip by Alan Moore in a 1980s boys comic <em>Warrior</em>. (The pair met writing material for <em>Doctor Who Weekly</em>.) The story explored the career of a masked activist operating in a totalitarian England that was offered, somewhat implausibly, as a speculation about where Thatcherism might lead. (This version of the British 1990s has a centrally planned economy and concentration camps for Jews and leftists.)</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-3"></div></div></div><p >When Warner Brothers produced a film version of the strip in 2005, the Fawkes mask gained a new constituency. It was taken up by Anonymous, hacktivists who went after Islamic State, the Church of Scientology and Mastercard. The Occupy movement adopted it, too. (This photo shows a Guido clone on the steps of St Paul’s Cathedral in London.)</p><p >These days the mask is evidence of the horseshoe effect in politics. It has covered the faces of pro-democracy campaigners in Hong Kong, anti-vaxxers in Trafalgar Square and QAnon foot soldiers who stormed the Capitol in January. And still they gather, all smiles. Time Warner, which earns a percentage of each mask sold, may smile the widest.</p><figure data-image-nozoom="true"><div itemscope="" itemProp="image" itemType="https://schema.org/ImageObject"><meta itemProp="url" content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/853/90/1843magazine.com/sites/default/files/1843_20210223_PROTESTSYMBOLS_007.jpg"/><img loading="lazy" width="1280" height="853" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/853/90/1843magazine.com/sites/default/files/1843_20210223_PROTESTSYMBOLS_007.jpg"  sizes="(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw" alt=""/></div></figure><p ><strong>What’s cooking? </strong>Wooden spoons, Burkina Faso <em>2014</em><br/> In 1987 Blaise Compaoré became president of Burkina Faso by accident, one in which his predecessor, Captain Thomas Sankara, just happened to be riddled with bullets and buried in an unmarked grave. Compaoré’s own departure, 27 years later, was more purposeful and less bloody.</p><p >On October 31st 2014, female protesters took to the streets of Ouagadougou to protest against Compaoré’s plan to rewrite the constitution and prolong his time in office. They blew whistles, shouted slogans, stood among banners comparing the president to the Ebola virus, and waved their <em>pilons</em> – long, spoon-like pestles used to mash the sorghum that forms the main ingredient of <em>tô</em>, the principal carb in Burkinabe cuisine. Police replied with tear gas. Demonstrators burned tyres. After several days of uproar, Compaoré stood down. “Women with wooden spoons”, said one commentator, “actually cooked revolution soup.”</p><p >In a sense, the recipe was an old one: Thomas Sankara, the man whose murder brought Compaoré to power, was the author of a feminist tract that is still studied today. “There is no true social revolution”, he wrote, “without the liberation of women.” But today Burkina Faso remains so volatile that, according to the <small>UN</small>, 47% of Burkinabe women have been forced to flee their homes.</p><figure data-image-nozoom="true"><div itemscope="" itemProp="image" itemType="https://schema.org/ImageObject"><meta itemProp="url" content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/853/90/1843magazine.com/sites/default/files/1843_20210223_PROTESTSYMBOLS_008.jpg"/><img loading="lazy" width="1280" height="853" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/853/90/1843magazine.com/sites/default/files/1843_20210223_PROTESTSYMBOLS_008.jpg"  sizes="(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw" alt=""/></div></figure><p ><strong>Brollywood </strong>Yellow umbrellas, Hong Kong <em>2015</em><br/> Revolutions – particularly ones against communist authorities – now come colour-coded. (Orange in Ukraine, rose in Georgia, tulip in Kyrgyzstan.) Sometimes these choices arise spontaneously; sometimes they’re decided by committee.</p><p >The yellow umbrellas that opened like a field of buttercups in the Hong Kong protests of 2014 offered more than just an eye-catching flourish: they were part of a revolutionary toolkit, providing a barrier against pepper spray, reducing the impact of rubber bullets and concealing the faces of demonstrators from security cameras. The official response was to reclassify the umbrella as a weapon and prevent Chinese e-commerce sites such as Taobao and AliExpress selling them to customers in Hong Kong.</p><p >In the past seven years, as the “one country two systems” principle has decayed, the stakes have risen, police action has become tougher and periodic street disturbances have grown more intense. The tumultuous events of last year – the siege of universities, Beijing-friendly candidates trounced in local elections, clashes between protesters, counter-protesters and police – made the construction worker’s hat and the respirator part of the pro-democracy kit bag. Expect more hard rain to fall.</p><figure data-image-nozoom="true"><div itemscope="" itemProp="image" itemType="https://schema.org/ImageObject"><meta itemProp="url" content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/932/90/1843magazine.com/sites/default/files/1843_20210223_PROTESTSYMBOLS_009.jpg"/><img loading="lazy" width="1280" height="932" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/932/90/1843magazine.com/sites/default/files/1843_20210223_PROTESTSYMBOLS_009.jpg"  sizes="(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw" alt=""/></div></figure><p ><strong>A fur cry </strong>Pussyhat <em>2017</em><br/> Remember President Donald Trump? He was that guy with the hair who was caught on camera bragging to Jeb Bush’s currant-eyed cousin Billy about his <em>droit-du-seigneurial</em> attitude to the American vagina. Responses to these recorded comments were manifold. Electing Trump to the White House, was, admittedly, the most obvious, but on January 21st 2017, the day after the inauguration, around 4m women worldwide registered their dissent by taking to the streets – many in this distinctive pink headgear, knitted from a pattern distributed online by Krista Suh, an artist and screenwriter.</p><p >It began as a Los Angeles community craft project and became a global phenomenon. Now these objects are in museum collections across the world, beside images of that day. Up close you notice their softness and the simplicity of Suh’s design. (Anything too elaborate would have defeated the purpose.)</p><p >Aerial photographs show something else.

Protesters in Bangkok started bringing them to anti-government demonstrations last year – worn as headgear, carried as mascots and, in pool-size inflatable form, serving as shields against the onslaught of the purple-dye water cannon.</p><p >The ducks gave the Royal Thai Army something to aim at, but they also reduced their state-sponsored violence to a post-modern spectacle. Battered and deflated ducks, dripping with indelible dye, were carried home in triumph.</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-4"></div></div></div><p >The anatine element of the Thai protests began as a joke about the inaccessibility of Bangkok’s riverside parliament, but the duck has a longer history as a symbol of resistance. In 2013 Hong Kong activists Photoshopped one into the famous photograph of the unidentified man who faced the Tiananmen Square tanks. (In response, Chinese social-media platform Weibo blocked the search terms “big yellow duck”.)</p><p >For demonstrators, the symbol is well-chosen. In a fairground the rubber duck is the quarry but never the prize.
