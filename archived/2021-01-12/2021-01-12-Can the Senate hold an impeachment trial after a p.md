The constitution defines impeachable offences as “Treason, Bribery, or other High Crimes and Misdemeanors.” Most House Democrats believe that President Donald Trump’s incitement of the storming of the Capitol on January 6th more than qualifies. Nancy Pelosi, the Speaker of the House, declared Mr Trump an “imminent threat” to America’s democracy and constitution. On January 11th House Democrats introduced an article of impeachment alleging that Mr Trump “threatened the integrity of the democratic system, interfered with the peaceful transition of power and imperiled a coequal branch of government”. It charges him with “incitement of insurrection”. The House may vote on the second impeachment of Mr Trump’s presidency as early as January 13th. Meanwhile, Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, has said that a Senate trial could not begin until January 19th, a day before Joe Biden’s inauguration. This timing may seem to undercut the need for impeachment, yet many want to proceed. Why?</p><p >Impeachment proceedings have two stages. After the House proposes articles of impeachment, it votes; if a simple majority approves, as it did on December 18th 2019, the president is impeached. Then the Senate holds a trial; if a two-thirds majority votes to convict, the president is removed from office. House Democrats seem to have the numbers: at least 210 have already signed on, with 218 constituting a majority. The Senate is another story. A year ago it acquitted Mr Trump of charges of improperly exerting pressure on Ukraine to provide damaging information on Mr Biden. This time several Republican senators have harshly criticised Mr Trump—including Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania and Mitt Romney of Utah—but have kept mum on whether they may vote to convict. Only Ben Sasse of Nebraska has said he would consider it. In the current Senate 22 Republicans would need to join 45 Democrats to reach the required threshold of a two-thirds vote. When the new Senate convenes next week, 17 Republicans would need to join 50 Democrats to seal a conviction.</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p >But if the primary function of impeachment is to remove a sitting president, what would be the point of using it against one who has already left? James Clyburn, the House majority whip, said on January 10th that the House may delay sending the impeachment article, once approved, to the Senate. Waiting 100 days would give the new Congress time to get going on Mr Biden’s legislative priorities. Another possibility, suggested by Mr Biden on January 11th, is to intersperse legislative and impeachment business so the Senate could deal with both processes in the weeks ahead. Democrats’ motivation seems to be threefold—symbolic, practical and political. The symbolic motivation is clear: no president has ever been convicted on impeachment articles. Holding Mr Trump accountable for his actions that led to the invasion of the Capitol that caused six deaths would tell America and the rest of the world that some things are odious enough to transcend partisanship. Practically, the process could preclude a comeback presidential run by Mr Trump in 2024; via a separate vote, the Senate could disqualify him from holding any “office of honour, trust or profit”. And politically, a trial would force Republicans either to stand with the outgoing president or denounce him, exposing a rift within the party.</p><p >A tricky question remains: Democrats may want to do this, but can they? As with many of Mr Trump’s actions this raises a novel constitutional quandary. Nobody has been impeached after leaving office, but the constitution does not forbid it and may implicitly permit it. The founders could not have intended to insulate outgoing presidents from the bounds of acceptable behaviour late in their terms. And if there is some deadline by which Congress must begin impeachment proceedings against a president, when would that be? Impeaching an ex-president, or trying him in the Senate after an impeachment, seems to be corollary of Congress’s constitutional check on executive action. And it could prevent the guilty from ever occupying such a position of power again. </p>
