Effective distribution and a high uptake drove this vaccine victory. But it is a rare success. <a href="https://www.economist.com/united-states/2020/05/19/how-the-pandemic-threatens-native-americans-and-their-languages">Native Americans died of covid-19</a> at nearly twice the rate of white Americans. Their life expectancy is 4.4 years below the American average and they have the highest rates of pre-existing health conditions out of any ethnic or racial group in America. Unlike other groups, Native Americans are entitled to health care from the federal government, but the system is poorly run and funded. How does it work? And why is it failing?</p><p >During the 18th and 19th centuries, America’s federal government (and the British before it) signed treaties with Native American tribes. Many of them exchanged land for a commitment that the government would protect them, including by providing medical care. Rulings by the Supreme Court in the 1800s established that tribes are political bodies that control their internal affairs. But the tribes remain subject to federal law, and the federal government has a duty to provide for them, known as the “trust responsibility”. Congress affirmed the duty to provide health care in 1921 with the Snyder Act, which appropriated funds for Indian health care. This obligation covers enrolled members of federally-recognised tribes, which are political bodies, but does not apply to those who merely self-identify as Native American or belong to non-recognised tribes. Tribes themselves decide <a href="https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2018/10/25/the-controversies-over-claims-to-native-american-ancestry">who qualifies as a member</a>.</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p >Today, the Indian Health Service (IHS) is the main federal agency in charge of providing health care, serving about 2.6m of America’s Native Americans. The IHS is one of the core federally-administered health-care systems. Others include Medicare (for the elderly), Medicaid (for the hard-up) and the Veterans Health Administration. Medicare and Medicaid are public insurers, meaning the government pays for services but does not administer them, whereas the IHS is a direct health-care provider that operates some of its own facilities. Native Americans who live on or near reservations can get care from these, or from other facilities run by tribes (usually using some federal funding). But roughly 70% of Native Americans live in urban areas, away from IHS and tribally-operated facilities. For them, there are a small number of urban Indian health centres that provide care. But only 1% of the Indian Health Service’s budget is directed to these centres. Some cities, like Washington DC, have none. Stacy Bohlen, executive director of the National Indian Health Board and a member of the Sault Sainte Marie Tribe of Chippewa Indians, lives in Washington, DC. Because she could not get the covid-19 vaccine from an urban Indian health centre in her city, she took two days to travel to her tribe in Michigan for the jab. The government recommends that those with access to the IHS also have health insurance because the IHS offering is so limited. But many do not. Native Americans have the lowest rate of insurance coverage out of any ethnic or racial group in America, with 21.7% of the non-elderly uninsured in 2019. </p><p >Critics of the IHS argue the agency is underfunded and provides substandard care. Unlike Medicare and Medicaid, its funding does not grow in line with the size of the population using it. Instead it depends on annual grants from Congress. Doctors and nurses are hard to recruit for positions, as IHS facilities tend to be small and rural. They usually offer only primary and emergency care. For those living on or near reservations, there is money set aside for more specialised care outside the IHS system but it is limited. The IHS estimates that current funding covers roughly 60% of the health-care needs of eligible Native Americans. In 2017, the Indian Health Service spent $4,078 per person, roughly half of what Medicaid shelled out. </p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p >The success of some tribes’ vaccine rollout may signal a positive change. Ms Bohlen says the pandemic has been a turning-point, in drawing attention to health care for Native Americans. President Joe Biden’s stimulus bill, which was passed in March, included a big increase in funding for tribes. Chuck Schumer, the Democratic Senate majority leader, said that the law “takes us a giant step closer to fulfilling our trust responsibilities to all Native Americans, Alaska Natives and Native Hawaiians.” The plan allocates an extra $6bn to Native American health-care systems (roughly double the current annual IHS budget). It also tackles problems related to health care, such as broadband access to improve telehealth services. Ms Bohlen says the number-one issue facing Native Americans has been invisibility. “People just don’t think about us. They don&#x27;t know that we’re here,” she says, “and now they do.” </p>
