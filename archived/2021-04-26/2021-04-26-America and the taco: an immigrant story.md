But as the German immigrants who had brought them over in the 19th century established themselves, these dishes became American staples. When Italians arrived in the following century, their cuisine was looked down on for its garlicky excesses. By the 1980s pizza was one of America’s favourite foods.</p><p >Mexican immigrants introduced America to the taco more than a century ago. The small, soft or fried tortillas, typically made of corn, are wrapped around a filling (usually meat) and topped with salsas and garnishes. They are ubiquitous and much-loved. Yet many people don’t see tacos as American. “They’re still considered ethnic foods, even though generations of Americans now have grown up on some type of Mexican food,” says Gustavo Arellano, author of “Taco <small>USA</small>: How Mexican Food Conquered America”.</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p >Look for the ingredients of tacos, from salsas to spices, and you’ll often find them in a Hispanic or international aisle in American supermarkets, where pasta was once stocked. There’s a popular myth in America that it’s common to get food poisoning from Mexican cuisine, though there’s no evidence for such a claim. Yet this story shows that some Americans still mistrust such dishes, says Arellano – or even Mexicans themselves. He attributes the slow integration of the dish to the long, painful history of the two countries’ relationship.</p><p data-caps="initial" ><span data-caps="initial">T</span>acos have been eaten in Mexico for centuries, ever since someone realised that if you soak corn in alkaline water, it becomes soft enough to grind into flour and pat out into a tortilla. We’ll never know the ingredients of the original taco, but beans, squash and chilli peppers were probably included. In the 19th century small restaurants – called <em>taquerías</em> – emerged to flog tacos to workers in Mexico City. Regional cuisine filled the tortillas: <em>birria</em> (goat stew) from Jalisco in the west of the country, <em>cochinita pibil</em> (slow-cooked pork) from the Yucatán peninsula in the south-east.</p><blockquote><p>Despite the ubiquity of the taco, many feel the food is not yet seen as American</p></blockquote><p >Of the many Mexicans who fled the country during the revolutionary war (1910-24), most went to California – and they took the taco with them. Over time more Mexicans came to America, usually to do jobs other people didn’t want, such as fruit picking and dishwashing. By 1930 Mexicans made up nearly a tenth of Los Angeles’ population.</p><figure data-image-nozoom="true"><div itemscope="" itemProp="image" itemType="https://schema.org/ImageObject"><meta itemProp="url" content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/1280/90/1843magazine.com/sites/default/files/1843_20210420_WIAD-TACOS_002.jpg"/><img loading="lazy" width="1280" height="1280" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/1280/90/1843magazine.com/sites/default/files/1843_20210420_WIAD-TACOS_002.jpg"  sizes="(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw" alt=""/></div></figure><p >Tacos turned from workers’ food into a treat served in restaurants decorated with ersatz versions of Mexican culture. In 1930, in a bid to attract tourists, the Mexican restaurants of Olvera Street in downtown <small>LA</small> were ordered by city officials to dress their staff in “native” costumes, such as anachronistic, Spanish-style gowns.</p><blockquote><p>Immigrant cuisines tend to become richer and fattier when they arrive in America</p></blockquote><p >Recipes were adapted to the tastes of their new customers. Ground beef became more common than pork, and cheddar cheese and iceberg lettuce replaced hot salsas. Mexican restaurants began to fry tortillas to make hard-shell tacos – immigrant cuisines tend to become richer and fattier when they arrive in America.</p><p >Then came Glen Bell, a young, white entrepreneur who in 1951 invented a machine that could fry six tacos at the same time. This allowed him to make tacos as fast as McDonald’s did burgers, and a mostly non-Mexican clientele started buying them. Bell opened the first Taco Bell in California in 1962: its mock-mudbrick exterior, tiled roof and bell tower were a nod to the Spanish missions of Southern California. These became the template for thousands of branches. Taco Bell took the taco even to parts of America where few Mexicans lived. It just wasn’t a dish that many people in Mexico City would have recognised.</p><p data-caps="initial" ><span data-caps="initial">I</span>n recent years the taco has started to win acclaim among the elite in America. Top chefs are creating fusion versions, such as Roy Choi’s celebrated Korean tacos. “The taco is becoming almost like an art object now for...innovation,” says Krishnendu Ray, professor of food studies at New York University.</p><figure data-image-nozoom="true"><div itemscope="" itemProp="image" itemType="https://schema.org/ImageObject"><meta itemProp="url" content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/1280/90/1843magazine.com/sites/default/files/1843_20210420_WIAD-TACOS_003.jpg"/><img loading="lazy" width="1280" height="1280" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/1280/90/1843magazine.com/sites/default/files/1843_20210420_WIAD-TACOS_003.jpg"  sizes="(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw" alt=""/></div></figure><p >Upmarket <em>taquerías</em> are opening and Mexican chefs are gaining cachet. Carlos Gaytán became the first Mexican chef ever to get a Michelin star in 2013, for his restaurant in Chicago; the following year Cosme Aguilar was awarded one in New York. Tacos were once sold as cheap street food. Now you can buy a lamb <em>barbacoa</em> with squash blossom at Oxomoco in Brooklyn for $18.</p><blockquote><p>The lamb barbacoa with squash blossom at Oxomoco in Brooklyn goes for $18</p></blockquote><p >The taco’s elevation reflects the broader status of Mexican-Americans. People of Mexican origin now make up 11% of America’s population. Fewer Mexicans are entering America as low-skilled labourers or undocumented migrants; more people of Mexican origin hold college degrees and have become American citizens. Mexican-Americans occupy prominent positions in business, culture and politics, including three seats in the current Senate. After years of biting discrimination, the taco is finally getting the recognition it deserves.<span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p><p ><strong>Alice Fordham</strong> is a freelance journalist</p><p >ILLUSTRATIONS: <strong>BETH HOECKEL</strong></p>
