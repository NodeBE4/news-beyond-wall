But America has made more progress <a href="https://www.economist.com/united-states/2021/04/03/americans-are-rushing-to-get-vaccinated-as-covid-19-cases-spread">vaccinating its population</a> than any of these nations save Britain, and, experts say, it is on track to have hundreds of millions of excess doses this year.</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p >Mr Biden has said he wants America to return to a leadership role in the world. The fact that he is hesitating to show such leadership on vaccination—and has come under almost no domestic pressure to change course—is partly a result of America’s devastating experience of the pandemic. But that shock has only intensified a shift that was already underway: America is once again turning inward. Mr Trump may be gone from the White House, but the impulse to put America first has if anything become stronger, because now the left is exhibiting it as well as the right. Beset by domestic questions of racial equity; fearful about the future of jobs, education and infrastructure; depleted by wars in the Middle East; and divided from one another on all these matters, Americans are paying little attention to troubles abroad.</p><p >“Everybody is thinking, how do you develop a new constituency for foreign policy?” says Anne-Marie Slaughter, the chief executive officer of New America, a think tank, and a top State Department official under President Barack Obama. Ms Slaughter, who co-authored an essay in the journal <em>Foreign Affairs</em> last month calling on the administration to “vaccinate the world”, said that for some analysts, America today is like “postwar Britain, realising the limits of its power—an analogy I don’t like” because it implies long-term decline.</p><p >Internationalists in both parties are in retreat. It was not lost on those who still argue for greater engagement with the world that Mr Biden, a student of foreign policy, devoted only half a dozen sentences to it in his inaugural address. On trade as on other matters, Mr Biden and his top aides stress that they are thinking first about how to make America stronger. Jake Sullivan, Mr Biden’s national security adviser, likes to repeat that “foreign policy is domestic policy, and domestic policy is foreign policy”.</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p >Protected by two oceans, America has always been drawn to isolationism. It may have had a messianic view of its role, but through most of its history it saw itself showing the way forward by example, rather than by enmeshing itself in what Thomas Jefferson disparaged as “entangling alliances”. Mr Biden has invoked that tradition to build support for his domestic agenda. As he put it in it in his inaugural speech, “We will lead not merely by the example of our power but by the power of our example.”</p><p >The administration has taken some steps toward helping the rest of the world protect itself against covid-19. Earlier this month Mr Biden appointed Gayle Smith, a former Obama administration official who led America’s response to Ebola, to co-ordinate its global response to the virus. America has pledged $4bn, more than any other country, to COVAX, the scheme meant to ensure that all countries have access to at least some doses of vaccine. And America has also loaned 4m doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine to Mexico and Canada.</p><p >That said, America is believed to be sitting on another 26m doses of that vaccine, which is not yet cleared for use in the United States. That is more than half the 43m doses of vaccine that COVAX has distributed so far, to 119 countries. The Biden administration has also locked up hundreds of millions of doses of other vaccines. “It doesn’t matter how much money COVAX has if there’s nothing to buy,” said Andrea Taylor, assistant director of programmes at the Duke Global Health Innovation Centre. “Why isn’t there more pressure from Americans to actually push for global equity?”</p><p >She said America could divert some doses overseas, either via COVAX or through bilateral arrangements. America could also revise the delivery schedule of its orders, allowing vaccine makers to begin shipping some of their monthly production elsewhere. So far, some 226m doses of vaccine have been administered in America, compared with 15m on the entire continent of Africa. On April 21st, the day Mr Biden announced that 200m jabs had been administered to Americans, Politico, which covers Washington politics, posted a story with this headline: “States have a new Covid problem: Too much vaccine”. Vaccination rates are declining in America, since those eager to get the jab have largely been able to do so. As the medicine begins to pile up, Mr Biden should have a freer hand politically to divert more of it overseas.</p><p >The devastating surge of covid-19 cases in India is capturing the administration’s attention. On April 25th Mr Sullivan assured Ajit Doval, India’s national security adviser, that material needed to manufacture the AstraZeneca vaccine “will immediately be made available”, according to a White House statement. The statement did not mention materials needed for a second vaccine, Novovax. The Serum Institute of India, which manufactures both vaccines, had previously <a href="https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2021/04/22/american-export-controls-threaten-to-hinder-global-vaccine-production">appealed to America</a> to lift export controls on 37 items, saying production would otherwise be disrupted in the coming weeks.</p><p >When asked about the Indian request on April 20th, Ned Price, the State Department spokesman, noted that America had suffered more deaths from covid-19—more than 550,000—than any other country. “It is not only in our interest to ensure that the American people are vaccinated,” he said. “The other point I would make is that the rest of the world has an interest in seeing that the American people are vaccinated and that the virus is brought under control here.”</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-3"></div></div></div><p >Yet Americans also have an interest in seeing the rest of the world vaccinated, according to epidemiological and economic models. Outbreaks of the disease elsewhere, like the eruptions now under way in India and Brazil, will constrain the global economy. And large amounts of circulating virus will create more variants of covid-19, some of which might spread faster, be more lethal or be better able to escape existing vaccines.</p><p >Dangerous variants “have a frightening ferocity and require really urgent and serious response, and this is a matter of geopolitical importance to us,” said Stephen Morrison, director of the Global Health Policy Centre at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies. On April 14th he issued a call for American action that was signed by a list of American luminaries in health and epidemiology. It urged Mr Biden to “make the case directly to the American people that US efforts abroad will secure the gains at home”.</p><p >Britain’s prime minister, Boris Johnson, has made a version of that argument. “It’s no use one country being far ahead of another,” he said in February, as he pledged to donate surplus British vaccine to poorer countries.</p><p >Beyond protecting Americans, the main reason to share more vaccine with the world is that it will prevent untold suffering and death elsewhere. As Americans protect themselves against covid-19, they would do well to guard against immunity to that consideration. Being generous is a way to set an example, too.</p><p ><strong>Dig deeper</strong></p><p ><em>All our stories relating to the pandemic and the vaccines can be found on our <a href="https://www.economist.com/news/2020/03/11/the-economists-coverage-of-the-coronavirus">coronavirus hub</a>.
