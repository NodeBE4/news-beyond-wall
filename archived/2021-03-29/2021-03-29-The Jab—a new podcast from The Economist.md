More than a hundred million shots have been administered since then, but the number of cases of covid-19 detected worldwide has also passed the hundred million mark. We’re in a race between infections and injections.</p><p >&quot;The Jab from Economist Radio&quot; is a new podcast reporting from the sharp end of the vaccination race. <i>The Economist</i>’s science and data teams, a global network of correspondents, and interviews with key players bring a unique perspective and depth of insight to the challenge of a generation.</p><p >As this race enters its most crucial phase we’ll keep you up to date with the latest developments and unpick the complex process that takes vaccines from the lab and into the arms of the people who need it.</p><p >The stakes couldn’t be higher. It’s the most ambitious inoculation programme the world has ever seen and the health and wealth of the planet is in the balance.</p><figure><div itemscope="" itemProp="image" itemType="https://schema.org/ImageObject" data-slim="0"><meta itemProp="url" content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1920/1080/90/sites/default/files/images/2021/01/blogs/podcasts/the_jab_presenters2.jpg"/><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1920/1080/90/sites/default/files/images/2021/01/blogs/podcasts/the_jab_presenters2.jpg"  sizes="(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw" alt=""/></div></figure><p >Each week Alok Jha, <i>The Economist</i>’s science correspondent, hosts with Natasha Loder, our health-policy editor.
