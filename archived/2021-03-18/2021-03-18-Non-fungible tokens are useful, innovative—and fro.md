The Tate described the work as “a rectangular arrangement of 120 firebricks...altering the viewer’s relationship to the surrounding space”. The public called it a pile of bricks. A few years later newspapers execrated the gallery for having wasted brick-shaped wads of cash on the avant-garde work.</p><p >Once again, a famous institution is embracing a controversial new genre. On March 11th Christie’s sold a digital collage of images called “Everydays—The First 5,000 Days” for a cool $69.3m. The sale elevated the work’s creator, Mike Winkelmann, aka Beeple, to the august company of David Hockney and Jeff Koons, the only two living painters to sell at such prices.</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p >Christie’s sold the artwork as a “non-fungible token” (<small>NFT</small>)<small>,</small> a craze for which has gripped Silicon Valley’s elite. An <small>NFT</small> is a secure, <a href="https://www.economist.com/technology-quarterly/2018/08/30/what-to-make-of-cryptocurrencies-and-blockchains">blockchain-based record</a> that represents pieces of digital media. Invented a few years ago, it can link not only to digital art but also to text, videos or bits of code.</p><p >The pile-of-bricks criticism of digital artworks is that, in contrast to physical collectibles, they can be copied with perfect fidelity and consumed infinitely online. They thus have limited inherent value. A token brings bragging rights to a unique, authenticated version of a digital artwork, song or cute image of a cat (which first earned <small>NFT</small>s their popularity). Another attraction for the creative world is that <small>NFT</small>s make it easy to build in payments to artists when their works are sold on.</p><p >Since almost anything can be tokenised and sold if punters are willing, the craze stretches beyond pictures. Kings of Leon, a rock band, is selling a new album as an <small>NFT</small> and the National Basketball Association is selling clips of famous dunks. Creators can turn to a growing collection of marketplaces, such as OpenSea and Nifty Gateway. Even individual tweets are going for big sums (leading some to wonder if the former tweeter-in-chief, Donald Trump, could flog bits of his oeuvre).</p><p >The bumper Beeple sale, plus the arrival of ever more creators, means a mania that has been largely confined to crypto and techie circles could move mainstream. The global <small>NFT</small> market grew from a few tens of millions of dollars in annual sales a few years ago to over $300m in the past month alone, according to Andreessen Horowitz, a venture-capital firm. <small>NFT</small>s mesh with the massive network effects of social media and meme culture, notes Sam Hart of the Interchain Foundation, a Swiss backer of blockchain infrastructure. There has been little time to educate buyers, he says.</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p >The pitfalls are being called out by a few crypto experts. One worry is that broad crypto-enthusiasm may be what is really behind soaring <small>NFT</small> values. It has not gone unnoticed that the buyer of Beeple’s “Everydays” is Metakovan, a professional crypto investor. Christie’s got its $69.3m in Ether, a cryptocurrency.</p><p >Some compare the <small>NFT</small> craze to the <a href="https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2017/09/16/initial-coin-offering-means-investor-caution-obligatory">boom in initial coin offerings</a>, a form of crowdfunding in which firms issue digital “coins” in return for a payment, in 2017-18, which turned to bust soon after. The soaring prices of many <small>NFT</small>s, reliant on ephemeral buzziness in places like Clubhouse, a hot new audio app, could quickly collapse. Celebrities including Lindsay Lohan jumping on a trend that was meant to be about helping penniless artists is, some reckon, another ominous sign. The upfront costs of “minting” <small>NFT</small>s are low, meanwhile, meaning potentially unlimited supply. (For now <small>NFT</small>s’ huge carbon footprint, owing to energy-intensive blockchain transactions, is not transparently recorded.)</p><p >A final uncertainty around <small>NFT</small>s’ value is that they can in practice be separated from the digital good to which they are tied, undermining their worth. A creator can change the image even after sale. One crypto artist recently “pulled the rug” on some <small>NFT</small>s to highlight the flaw. A series of colourful digital portraits suddenly metamorphosed into pictures of antique carpets. But the art market has always been prone to dodgy dealing. Picking <small>NFT</small>s looks akin to sorting real Rembrandts from those daubed by mere followers. <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p><p data-test-id="Footnote" >This article appeared in the Finance &amp; economics section of the print edition under the headline &quot;What’s wrong with this picture?&quot;</p><br><hr><div>获取更多RSS：<br><a href="https://feedx.net" style="color:orange" target="_blank">https://feedx.net</a> <br><a href="https://feedx.top" style="color:orange" target="_blank">https://feedx.top</a><br></div>
