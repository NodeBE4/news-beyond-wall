It is possible, but unlikely. The story is so well worn that its appearance in a new film, “Creation Stories”—starring Ewen Bremner as Mr McGee alongside a cast of look-not-very-much-alikes—is as inevitable as James Bond getting involved in an implausible chase or Christopher Nolan introducing an impenetrable plot twist.</p><p >The scene is as necessary as it is ordained. Given that Mr McGee is best known as “The Man Who Signed Oasis”, to leave the incident out of a movie about his life would have seemed perverse at best, even if it is far from the most interesting thing about either him or his label. But then “Creation Stories”—based on Mr McGee’s memoir of the same title—is very much his version of the Creation story. The book, and the film, tell an attractive if familiar tale. A child whose dad doesn’t understand him flees home to pursue fame and, through drive and perspicacity, and with the help of a cast of friends of wildly different personalities, achieves it, then crashes, before finding redemption. </p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p >“Creation Stories” glosses over the oddness and divisiveness of the record label and Mr McGee himself. In the summer of 1988, during one of Creation’s early peaks, Mr McGee released a budget-priced sampler album called “Doing It For The Kids”. He put on an all-day gig featuring most of the label’s roster at the Town and Country Club in north London, with tickets priced at £3.50 (a bargain even by the standards of the time). You might think fans would have been grateful for the chance to see My Bloody Valentine, Primal Scream, The House of Love, Felt and a great many more for such a pittance, but this writer recalls Mr McGee standing at the back of the room and people swearing angrily at him as they walked past. He was releasing some of the defining indie records of that era but Mr McGee was rarely loved, more often mocked and despised.</p><p >The length of a feature film does not allow for the byways of Creation to be explored—for that, readers should turn to “My Magpie Eyes Are Hungry For the Prize” by the late David Cavanagh, one of the great music books—but the wrinkles are where the real fascination of Creation lay. Creation was a label that achieved success despite itself. For every work of brilliance, of which there were many, there were ridiculous gestures such as “Chernobyl Baby” by Baby Amphetamine, Creation’s genuinely terrible attempt at a girl group/electro/hip-hop record, or Mr McGee’s efforts to convince the world that 3 Colours Red, a journeyman pop-punk group, were the new Sex Pistols. </p><p >Even when sticking to what it did best—guitar music in thrall to 1967 and 1977, the high points of psychedelia and punk—Creation had an attitude to quality control that tended towards the lax, often because the need to generate turnover to keep the bailiffs at bay meant it would put out more or less anything. With startling frequency, though, Creation made records that were hugely important to fans, to musicians and to other people who wanted to set up record labels. And that part of both Mr McGee’s and Creation’s history—its role as a catalyst to a generation—has no place in “Creation Stories”. </p><p >It is now more than 20 years since Mr McGee closed down Creation. Nowadays, with digital technology, it is easier than ever to release music. But with the waning of the music press, it is also harder than ever for the budding McGees—the people who, through force of personality, can persuade the world that a mediocre seven-inch single recorded for a pittance might change it—to become known. “Creation Stories” reminds viewers that the world is a less colourful place without them. </p><p ><em>“Creation Stories” will be released in Britain on March 20th via Sky Cinema</em></p>
