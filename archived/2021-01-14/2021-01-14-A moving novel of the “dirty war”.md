The junta killed, “disappeared” and tortured thousands of Argentines, from members of left-wing groups such as the Montoneros to writers and artists thought to be voices of dissent. In “Hades, Argentina” Mr Loedel travels back with his narrator into this haunted past.</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p >The haunting is literal. Tomás, an Argentine living in New York, returns to Buenos Aires in the mid-1980s, hoping to put “stubborn ghosts back in their graves”. Instead he is reunited with his first love, Isabel—a Montonera who was murdered by the junta years before. After some initial alarm, Tomás takes this supernatural reunion in his stride. He has anyway been drifting for years, struggling with the aftermath of trauma and often feeling like a ghost himself.</p><p >Soon another shade—of his one-time mentor, a character known as the Colonel—invites him to visit a uniquely Argentine underworld, comprising an eternally looping version of the dirty war. Tomás immediately accepts. He knows this time-travel will be agonising, but also that it may be his only opportunity to forgive himself for the wrenching choices he once made.</p><p >Tomás is ashamed of having survived; in a compelling nuance, he is also ashamed of having abetted torture. While in medical school, he let Isabel persuade him to embed himself at a military torture centre, where he treated prisoners and spied for the Montoneros. Flashback and re-enactment blur in an extended account of his spell at the (real, infamous) Automotores Orletti, a clandestine prison where the junta tortured leftists from several countries. Mr Loedel handles these atrocities with tact, describing only what Tomás sees in person; not violence, but its aftermath. On his first day, for instance, he is called to defibrillate a prisoner. The man “died a few weeks later”, Tomás says; “his heart stopped again, only this time on one of my days off. I took fewer after that.”</p><p >The plain delicacy of Mr Loedel’s prose suits not only the horror of his subject, but also his novel’s risky premise. A voyage to the underworld could easily become outlandish, or, conversely, too familiar—trapped in the worn formulas of myth or magical-realist tropes. In “Hades, Argentina”, though, hell is at once metaphor and setting, literary conceit and emotional reality. Tomás’s sojourn there is a fittingly moving tribute to the author’s sister and her many fellow victims. <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p><p data-test-id="Footnote" >This article appeared in the Books &amp; arts section of the print edition under the headline &quot;Unquiet ghosts&quot;</p>
