Each would serve 18 months as prime minister, with Mr Netanyahu going first. “I will leave office on the agreed date,” he promised. ”There will be no tricks, no shticks.” Even at the time, many Israelis did not believe him.</p><p >Now it seems clear that Mr Netanyahu had no intention of handing over power. Regardless, he is no longer bound by the agreement with Mr Gantz. At midnight on December 22nd, having failed to pass a budget, the Knesset (Israel’s parliament) was automatically dissolved, triggering a poll on March 23rd. It will be Israel’s fourth election in two years.</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p >Mr Netanyahu had ordered the finance minister, a member of his right-wing Likud party, to take his time preparing the budget. This was a political move—an effort to time the government’s collapse for when the polls looked best for Mr Netanyahu. But enough MPs were fed up with the manoeuvring. Three of Mr Gantz’s colleagues in his centrist Blue and White party and one Likud member voted against a bill that would have extended the budget deadline, sinking it.</p><p >For Mr Netanyahu the timing isn’t perfect. Both he and Mr Gantz urged their members to vote for extending the deadline. The prime minister’s hesitation has a lot to do with Gideon Sa’ar, who resigned from the Knesset and left Likud earlier this month (he had previously challenged Mr Netanyahu for its leadership). Mr Sa’ar has set up a new party, New Hope, which is expected to draw other Likud defectors.</p><p >Polls show New Hope sapping support from Likud. And the challenge to Mr Netanyahu from the right doesn’t stop there. Two other parties led by former allies of the prime minister—Naftali Bennett and Avigdor Lieberman (both former defence ministers)—are expected to do well. Together they may draw enough nationalist and religious voters, Mr Netanyahu’s base, to deny him the support he needs to stay in power. Israel’s centrist and left-wing parties would probably join a coalition led by Mr Sa’ar if it meant getting rid of Mr Netanyahu.</p><p >Israel’s centrist and left-wing parties don’t stand much of a chance on their own. Labour, the party of the state’s Zionist-Socialist founders, will be lucky to win a handful of seats. Mr Gantz, meanwhile, largely discredited himself by joining Mr Netanyahu in government after promising voters he wouldn’t. The centrist ex-general claimed the move was necessary so that the country could fight covid-19. But most voters think he was outwitted by the prime minister, who has held on to power for longer than any previous Israeli leader.</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p >Mr Netanyahu hopes to finally gain a majority that might grant him immunity from prosecution on multiple charges of fraud and bribery. At the moment, that seems unlikely. The prime minister’s popularity has plummeted because of the government’s shoddy handling of covid-19 and its effect on the economy. But things are slowly changing. Mr Netanyahu has publicised his phone calls with vaccine-makers, urging them to prioritise deliveries to Israel, and was at the airport when the first consignment arrived. On December 19th he became the first Israeli to get the vaccine—on live television of course (see picture). He is hoping the vaccination drive also gives his campaign a shot in the arm.</p>
