In the mid-1900s swing voters comprised about a tenth of the electorate; these days just one voter in 20 considers both Democratic and Republican candidates. Such political polarisation has been blamed for many of society’s ills—from an erosion of trust in government to an increase in quarrels at family gatherings. But less attention has been paid to the economic impact of political discord. According to a <a href="https://www.economist.comhttps://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3701230">new working paper</a>, partisanship makes borrowing more expensive for American firms—and the effect gets worse around elections.</p><p >Researchers from Indiana University and the University of Rochester examined almost 3,000 syndicated loans, with a combined value of nearly $2.5trn, issued between 1998 and 2019. They then matched the bankers in charge of underwriting the loans—who were identified using information contained in SEC filings—with voting records from LexisNexis, a subscription database service, to determine their political party affiliations at the time the loans were issued. The researchers found that bankers whose political beliefs differed from those of the president charged companies more to borrow money than those who supported the party in control of the White House, levying 7% higher spreads (the rate of interest compared with the cost of the money) on average.</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p >Why are bankers opposed to the president so much stingier with their loans? The researchers reckon it is because they are more pessimistic about the country’s economic outlook, and therefore more cautious when doling out cash. They argue that loan officers have significant discretion to influence borrowing terms, even within big banks. Although credit committees often determine banks’ lending, the individuals who work closely with borrowers also have sway over the loans offered.</p><p >The effect is exacerbated when a banker cannot easily evaluate a borrower’s creditworthiness, for example when a company has a dodgy credit rating. In such cases, economic prospects and other factors beyond the firm’s control—including the lender’s personal biases—become more important in influencing the terms of the loan. This partisan misalignment in loan pricing peaked immediately after Donald Trump’s election in 2016, when the interest-rate spreads charged by bankers who opposed the president rose by 26% compared with a base period of 2014-15.</p><p >It is not just corporate loans that are affected by political divisions. Another recent <a href="https://www.economist.comhttps://www.nber.org/papers/w25292">working paper</a> found that credit-rating analysts can also be swayed by their personal political beliefs. Over a four-year presidential term, analysts who disagree with the president rate the average company about 0.21 notches lower than those who support him. This is equivalent to a one-notch downgrade for one in five firms. As with loans, the biggest divergence between Democratic and Republican analysts occurred after the election in 2016.</p><p >Bankers may not be deliberately penalising firms just because they do not like who is in the White House, but their lack of faith in a president’s ability to steer the economy can nevertheless hurt companies’ bottom lines. And the effect is greatest when political views are most polarised. After another divisive election this year, American firms could find themselves paying dearly.</p><br><hr><div>获取更多RSS：<br><a href="https://feedx.net" style="color:orange" target="_blank">https://feedx.net</a> <br><a href="https://feedx.xyz" style="color:orange" target="_blank">https://feedx.xyz</a><br></div>
