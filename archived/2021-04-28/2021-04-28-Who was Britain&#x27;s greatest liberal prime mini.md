To mark the occasion, The Economist journalists Emma Duncan and Adrian Woolridge joined Margaret MacMillan, Michael Gove, Charles Moore and Dan Hannan to debate a crucial question: who was Britain&#x27;s greatest liberal prime minister? In a live subscriber event, each panellist made the case for a prime minister. The winner was decided by our audience. </p><p >You can watch the debate in full below.</p><p ><iframe height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rjarv2qrtq8?enablejsapi=1"></iframe></p><p >Liberalism is at <a href="https://www.economist.com/leaders/2018/09/13/a-manifesto-for-renewing-liberalism">the heart of what The Economist stands for</a>.
