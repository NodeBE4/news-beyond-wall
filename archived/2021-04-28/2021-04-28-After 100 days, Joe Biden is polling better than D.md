During his first three and a half months as commander-in-chief Mr Biden has signed a record number of executive orders to roll back the policies of Donald Trump, and unveiled an ambitious set of policies to tackle the pandemic, improve infrastructure and boost the economy. So far, the public likes what it sees. Most Democrats and Independents approve of the job the president is doing; and although most Republicans disapprove of him, he is more popular with the opposing party than his immediate predecessor.</p><p >According to the latest <em>The Economist</em>/YouGov poll, released on April 28th, 50% of voters approve of the job Mr Biden is doing as president, whereas 39% disapprove. Those numbers are nearly the inverse of Mr Trump’s approval ratings at this point in his tenure, when 40% of voters approved of him and 50% disapproved. (Mr Biden’s popularity still lags behind that of Barack Obama, his former boss, who enjoyed the support of 55% of voters at the 100-day mark.) Compared with Mr Trump, Mr Biden has managed to win over more members of his own party and upset fewer of them. Some 89% of Democrats approve of Mr Biden, and just 7% disapprove; at the same point in his presidency, 82% of Republicans approved and 14% disapproved of Mr Trump.</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p >Mr Biden’s policies have been broadly popular, too. According to YouGov 64% of voters like the president’s $1.9trn stimulus bill, which was signed into law on March 11th; just 31% opposed it. By comparison, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, Mr Trump’s signature legislative achievement, attracted the support of just a third of voters when it was passed in December 2017. Mr Biden’s infrastructure proposal, which would spend $2trn on roads, bridges, public transport and broadband, among other things, is supported by 59% of Americans and opposed by just 21%, according to a recent NBC News poll. With a net approval rate of 38%, that makes it even more popular than the stimulus bill.</p><p >But things could get gloomier in the coming months. When American voters were polled by YouGov in January about their priorities for the government, most cited kitchen-table concerns such as economic growth, government spending and health care. Today more divisive issues, such as immigration, gun control and criminal justice, are higher on voters’ minds. Mr Biden’s honeymoon period may be coming to an end.</p>
