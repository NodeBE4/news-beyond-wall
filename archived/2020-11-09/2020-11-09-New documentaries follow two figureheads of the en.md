As water crashes into the boat, the teenage activist speaks into her phone, recording the journal that she is too seasick to write by hand. “I don’t want to have to do all this. It’s too much for me,” she says, her voice tired and her speech halting. “I know that this is important, and what’s at stake. But it’s such a lot of responsibility.”</p><p >“I Am Greta” follows Ms Thunberg, a Swedish schoolgirl and climate campaigner, over the course of one extraordinary year. Nathan Grossman, who directs, was a novice film-maker who decided to capture Ms Thunberg’s solitary protests outside the Swedish parliament in 2018. “I thought it would be a three-week shoot,” he has said, a “few minutes in a short, arty film about child activists”. Twelve months later, and he was still recording as she arrived in New York—by boat, as she will not fly on account of the emissions—for the United Nations Climate Summit. In the intervening time, the “Fridays for Future” school strikes had taken off, galvanising young people around the world to demand action on climate change. Ms Thunberg had become the face of this movement and was invited to speak at rallies and conferences across Europe. Her father and Mr Grossman followed in her wake. </p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p >The result is an intimate portrait of a young woman deeply uncomfortable with her fame. Ms Thunberg has Asperger’s syndrome, to which she credits her ability to “laser focus” on the problem of ecological collapse, but which also makes her nervous around anyone outside her family and their beloved pets. She struggles to make small talk, but she excels at giving speeches lambasting politicians’ inaction (the documentary shows her rigorous preparations for her UN address). </p><p >“I Am Greta” adroitly captures the tension between Ms Thunberg’s reticence and the way in which people react to her. There are echoes of Beatlemania when she appears in front of thousands of screaming protestors. At summits, delegates jockey to take selfies with her, telling her what an inspiration she is. Some world leaders request meetings with her in front of television cameras; others—such as Donald Trump, Jair Bolsonaro and Vladimir Putin—deride her as a mentally damaged attention-seeker. The dissonance demonstrates Ms Thunberg’s commitment to campaigning regardless of the personal cost; it also shows a public yearning for figureheads for the environmental movement. </p><figure><div itemscope="" itemProp="image" itemType="https://schema.org/ImageObject" data-slim="0"><meta itemProp="url" content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/720/90/sites/default/files/20201114_BKP502.jpg"/><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/720/90/sites/default/files/20201114_BKP502.jpg"  sizes="(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw" alt=""/></div></figure><p >That yearning is also evident in the career of Sir David Attenborough (pictured above), a man <a href="https://www.economist.comhttps://yougov.co.uk/topics/entertainment/articles-reports/2018/11/07/david-attenborough-most-popular-person-britain">found by YouGov to be the most popular person in Britain</a>. The 94-year-old television presenter declares that “A Life on Our Planet”, a documentary recently released on Netflix, is his “witness statement”: an account of the devastation of the natural world, as experienced across his seven-decade career. It is a marked departure from much of his output for the BBC, which often rounded out an hour of glossy footage of flora and fauna with a few minutes of environmental warning. Instead, “A Life on Our Planet” opens in the wreckage left by the Chernobyl nuclear disaster—a visual metaphor for the harm mankind has inflicted on the planet—and offers grim statistics on the amount of wilderness and biodiversity that have been destroyed in Sir David’s lifetime.</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p >Unlike Ms Thunberg, Sir David, now in his twilight years, is clearly at ease with leveraging his fame to impart a message. Images of natural abundance being replaced with scarcity are intercut with the presenter speaking directly to camera, moved almost to tears as he recalls what has been lost. Perhaps the most dramatic part of the film is a sequence describing the devastation to come, unless drastic action is taken—devastation Sir David will not personally live to see (but Ms Thunberg will). It includes the total loss of the Amazon rainforest, an ice-free Arctic, the death of coral reefs, fish and insect populations and increasingly erratic weather. </p><p >To watch “A Life On Our Planet” and “I Am Greta” is to marvel at the passion of these two campaigners, but both films and both figures emphasise that a collective response is required if environmental catastrophe is to be averted. Ms Thunberg expresses her exasperation that the policymakers who fawn over her, seemingly using her presence to boost their eco-credentials, decline to make the necessary structural changes. Sir David gives a convincing outline of the steps needed to avoid disaster, including moving rapidly away from animal agriculture and rewilding large tracts of the globe. Both Ms Thunberg and Sir David have special qualities that allow them to understand and champion the problems at hand. (For her: determination, personality and youth. For him: global recognition, goodwill and unique access to the natural world over a long career.) But the responsibility to take action now falls to everyone else.</p><p ><em>“I Am Greta” will be released on Hulu in America on November 13th. “David Attenborough: A Life On Our Planet” is available to stream on Netflix now</em></p>
