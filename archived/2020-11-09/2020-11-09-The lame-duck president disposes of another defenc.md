Donald Trump has now done so in a single term, firing Mark Esper on November 9th. The summary dismissal, in a presidential tweet declaring that “Mark Esper has been terminated”, and its probable motivation, a months-old grudge against Mr Esper, augur a rocky transition period until Joe Biden, the president-elect, takes office on January 20th.</p><p >Mr Trump’s first appointee, James Mattis, a revered former general, resigned in December 2018 in protest at Mr Trump’s capricious treatment of allies. He was succeeded by Patrick Shanahan, an aerospace executive, who himself pulled out of contention for the permanent job when a past domestic dispute came to light. Mr Esper, previously the secretary of the army, took the post in June 2019 and after another interlude—Richard Spencer filled the role for eight days to circumvent a rule on acting secretaries—was confirmed in July.</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p >In June 2020, as protests over racial injustice rocked America, Mr Esper outraged protesters first by encouraging state governors to “dominate the battlespace” and then by appearing alongside Mr Trump in Lafayette Square in Washington, DC, shortly before the area was forcibly cleared of peaceful demonstrators. Mr Esper quickly apologised for his bellicose language and—contradicting the president—said that he did not support invoking the Insurrection Act, a centuries-old law that would allow the domestic use of federal forces. Mr Trump was furious at that act of modest dissent.</p><p >In July Mr Esper angered the president again. First, he approved a promotion for Lieutenant-Colonel Alexander Vindman, who as director for European affairs on the National Security Council had been a key witness to the House of Representatives during Mr Trump’s impeachment inquiry in November 2019 (Colonel Vindman chose to retire). Then he issued an order that in effect banned the Confederate flag, a symbol of the pro-slavery South in America’s civil war, from military facilities. Days later, Mr Trump insisted that “when people proudly have their Confederate flags, they’re not talking about racism…It represents the South.”</p><p >That largely settled Mr Esper’s fate. In August the president publicly belittled his defence secretary, calling him “Mark Yesper”. In an interview with the <em>Military Times</em> on November 4th, published immediately after his firing, Mr Esper took pride in his record of standing up to the president, asking: “Who’s pushed back more than anybody? Name another Cabinet secretary that’s pushed back.” He went on: “I could have a fight over anything, and I could make it a big fight, and I could live with that—why? Who’s going to come in behind me? It’s going to be a real ‘yes man’. And then God help us.”</p><p >There are few precedents for the removal of a cabinet secretary after a president has lost an election. Even then, Mr Trump has found a way to tear up the rulebook with his characteristic disregard for laws and norms. In the flurry of tweets firing Mr Esper, the president said that he had appointed Christopher Miller, the director of the National Counterterrorism Centre (NCTC), as acting secretary of defence with immediate effect. One problem with this is that federal statute dictates that Mr Esper’s deputy, David Norquist, ought to take charge. It is not clear why he has been superseded.</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p >Another issue is that secretaries of defence who served in the armed forces are required to seek a congressional waiver if they have been retired for less than seven years (like Mr Mattis). Mr Miller retired six years ago, after three decades as an army officer. He is viewed as a competent official, rather than a partisan apparatchik. Yet he has vanishingly little experience of high office: he ran the NCTC for less than three months and, <span><span>before that, his highest permanent job was as a lowly </span><span>deputy assistant secretary of defence with responsibility for special forces.</span></span></p><p >“This is a legal move, but it is not a wise one,” says Peter Feaver, an expert on civil-military relations at Duke University who served in Bill Clinton’s and George W. Bush’s administrations. “Normally, administrations are begging the talent to stay through the lame-duck session so they can continue to govern responsibly.” One former Pentagon official points out that the change of leadership will disrupt the department’s budget submission for 2022, which is in preparation.</p><p >Another worry is that Mr Trump forced Mr Esper out in order to enable a reckless policy manoeuvre in the twilight of the administration, such as a rapid withdrawal of remaining American troops in Afghanistan. “It all has a terrible ‘burn it down’ on the way out feeling,” tweeted James Stavridis, a former American admiral and commander of NATO, referring to rumours that Mr Trump will follow up by firing the heads of the CIA and FBI. “More likely, Trump did this just for the petty joy of settling a score with Esper,” says Mr Feaver. “It weakens Trump, and likely hastens the decline of his power among Republicans who will see this for what it is.”</p><p ><strong>Dig deeper:</strong><br/><em>Read the <a href="https://www.economist.comhttps://www.economist.com/us-election-2020">best of our 2020 campaign coverage</a> and then sign up for Checks and Balance, our <a href="https://www.economist.com/checksandbalance/">weekly newsletter</a> and <a href="https://www.economist.com/checks-and-balance-our-weekly-podcast-on-american-politics">podcast</a> on American politics.</em></p><br><hr><div>获取更多RSS：<br><a href="https://feedx.net" style="color:orange" target="_blank">https://feedx.net</a> <br><a href="https://feedx.xyz" style="color:orange" target="_blank">https://feedx.xyz</a><br></div>
