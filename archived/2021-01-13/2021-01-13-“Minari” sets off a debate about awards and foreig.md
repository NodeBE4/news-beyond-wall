This year the biggest quarrel is over “Minari”, a film by Lee Isaac Chung based on his parents’ experience as Korean immigrants in Arkansas. It earned rave reviews from critics on its premiere at Sundance Film Festival in 2020 but will not be released to the American public until February. It made news, however, when the Hollywood Foreign Press Association (HFPA), which is responsible for the Golden Globes, announced that “Minari” would not be eligible for the Best Picture (Drama) category on the grounds that its dialogue is mostly in Korean. (The rules state that at least 50% of a film’s dialogue must be in English.) “Minari” would instead be competing for Best Foreign Language Film. </p><p >Film-makers have since criticised this decision, arguing that relegating an American-made film to a special category on the basis of its language is xenophobic. “I have not seen a more American film this year,” tweeted Lulu Wang, whose movie “The Farewell” (2019), about a Chinese-American woman visiting her family in Asia, was also entered into the Golden Globes as a foreign-language film. “We really need to change these antiquated rules that characterises [sic] American as only English-speaking.” Daniel Dae Kim, an actor, described the HFPA’s decision as “the film equivalent of being told to go back to your country when that country is actually America”.</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p >These artists are taking issue with the rule itself, rather than its application. The HFPA, for its part, says that “Minari” was only ever submitted for the Best Foreign Language Film category by A24, its distributor. Other foreign-language films from American directors, such as Mel Gibson’s “Apocalypto” and Clint Eastwood’s “Letters from Iwo Jima”, have also been prohibited from competing for Best Picture in years past; there was little controversy over those classifications. </p><p >Yet there are several reasons why “Minari” is being viewed differently. It is a smaller film, made on a low budget with no major stars, that may suffer from being siloed. It does not have action scenes or big war set-pieces to attract audiences. Unlike “Apocalypto” or “Iwo Jima” (which cost $50m and $19m to make, respectively) it is not being distributed by a major studio and was not the work of a well-known director. </p><p >Some in the film industry fear that “Minari” will be overlooked both by the general public and by the Academy Awards, which often take their cues from the Golden Globes. It won’t be eligible for Best International Film at the Oscars because that award is determined by a film’s country of origin, not its language, and “Minari” was conceived, funded, produced and distributed by American companies and artists. In other words, there is a discrepancy between the Oscars, which consider “Minari” an American film, and the Golden Globes, which see it as a foreign one.</p><p >But that is not the end of the story. The culture of Hollywood—and particularly of awards season—has changed, and films such as “Minari” are in less danger of being ignored. The #OscarsSoWhite campaign, which arose in 2016 after not a single non-white person was nominated in the acting categories, drew attention to the industry’s racial bias. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences launched various initiatives to diversify its membership and reward more inclusive films. When white-saviour movies such as “Green Book” win major awards, there is now a loud and angry backlash; the success of films including “Parasite”, which won Best Picture and Best International Film at the Oscars in 2020, is viewed not just as recognition of the movie’s artistic merits but also as a victory for the politics of representation. </p><p >The optimistic view, then, is that the brouhaha could work to the advantage of “Minari”. For a smaller distributor, controversy can be a powerful advertising tool; a British release has been announced in the wake of the debate. And even before this furore, there was a good chance that the film would screen well among the Academy’s more diverse membership. The outrage over the perceived snub could create an even bigger groundswell of support. Every year, there is one film that becomes the <em>cause célèbre</em> of critics and activists. This year, that may well be “Minari”.</p><br><hr><div>获取更多RSS：<br><a href="https://feedx.net" style="color:orange" target="_blank">https://feedx.net</a> <br><a href="https://feedx.xyz" style="color:orange" target="_blank">https://feedx.xyz</a><br></div>
