Safely across the border in Istanbul, they fill out paperwork registering themselves as asylum-seekers. Leila weeps on the phone to her mother, who has been left behind. “Sahand, what if my mother dies because of this?” she sobs.</p><p >“Love Child”, a documentary directed by Eva Mulvad, a Danish film-maker, is a harrowing, intimate reflection on the refugee experience. Shot over a six-year period, the film shows the family’s flight from Iran and arrival in Istanbul, where they establish themselves temporarily—or so they think—in a small apartment on the outskirts of the city. Having registered for resettlement with the United Nations, they expect a decision within a few months. But the year is 2012 and the war in Syria is intensifying. Hundreds of thousands of refugees are fleeing across the border into Turkey.</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p >Working at a foundry with other asylum-seekers, Sahand refreshes the UN website dozens of times a day, hoping to see an update on his status. There is a “Waiting for Godot” quality to the film, which conveys the tragedy and absurdity of a family waiting, as months stretch into years, for people who have never met or spoken to them to make decisions that will result in a new life in the West—or a return to Iran, where they will face execution.</p><p >Through several long sessions with a therapist, their stories are gradually revealed. Leila, who worked as a teacher in Iran, was married to an abusive drug addict who never consummated their marriage. A judge refused to sanction her request for divorce, leaving her trapped in an increasingly violent home. After falling in love with Sahand, she became pregnant. Were their affair to be discovered, they would both be executed. To protect themselves and their child, Leila somehow convinced her husband that the child was his and Mani grew up calling Sahand “uncle”.</p><p >Sahand’s situation is complex, too. Also married, he was pressured into becoming an informer for the Iranian secret service. After they began asking about Leila, he feared that the affair would come to light. Knowing that they might have to flee, he began secretly recording his interactions with his handlers to prove that he was coerced into working for them. But by absconding with sensitive information, he has put his life at even greater risk. The couple are also grappling with guilt that their flight may have endangered those they have left behind.</p><p >Ms Mulvad does not focus on the mechanics of seeking asylum; instead, “Love Child” is grounded in the day-to-day lives of its subjects, dwelling on the emotional toll the uncertainty, stress and tedium of the process takes on mother, father and child. Early on, after learning that Sahand is not his uncle but his father, Mani throws a tantrum. “It’s all your fault. It’s all because of you,” he screams at Sahand, hiccupping and choking as he sobs. “I won’t do as you say…You aren’t my father.” The boy’s confusion and hurt at being torn away from his home and friends are terrible to witness but it is the quiet pain on his father’s face that makes the scene heartbreaking.</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p >The intimacy of the footage—some of which was shot by the couple themselves—makes for a moving study of refugee life. Mani grows from a near-toddler to a bright and happy child. Sahand and Leila secure work as teachers at a local school and begin to form friendships with their neighbours and colleagues. But the precariousness of their situation is never far from the surface. As Mani’s and Sahand’s bond grows stronger, Leila and Sahand’s relationship comes under increasing strain. Their lack of control over their own lives fuels vicious arguments.</p><p >Ms Mulvad’s documentary creates a window into three lives subject to the seemingly arbitrary decisions of strangers. Yet moments of joy and tenderness puncture the tension. Leila’s delight when Sahand surprises her with a bike or writes her a poem, or Mani’s excitement when the couple decorate their small flat with balloons for his birthday, ensures that the film remains a love story at heart.</p><p ><em>“Love Child” will be released in virtual cinemas and on demand from November 6th</em></p>
