Covid-19 has halved the value of fracking firms this year. Rig counts are down (see chart). A perfect time for consolidation, then. Yet besides Chevron’s $5bn bid for Noble Energy in July, deals have been sparse. Buyers fret that investors will punish them for overpaying. Targets fear selling amid sinking oil prices. Many bosses’ yearly pay exceeds rewards from a sale, notes Devin McDermott of Morgan Stanley, a bank.

Devon’s share price jumped by 11% on the news.
