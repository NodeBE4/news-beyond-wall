Yet neither is looking very secure at the moment. Mr Netanyahu, the prime minister of Israel since 2009, is struggling to form a new government, as the opposition inches closer to a deal that would unseat him. Mr Abbas, the Palestinian president since 2005, is increasingly unpopular. Were he to hold a free and fair election, as he promised to do this year, he would probably lose. Could both men soon be out of a job?</p><div ><figure ><figcaption>Listen to this story</figcaption><audio  controls="" id="audio-player" preload="none" src="https://www.economist.com/media-assets/audio/034%20Middle%20East%20and%20Africa%20-%20Israel%20and%20Palestine-e99714619dcdccba0ad691f30d2df72a.mp3" title="Binyamin Netanyahu and Mahmoud Abbas try to hold on to power" controlsList="nodownload"><p>Your browser does not support the &lt;audio&gt; element.</p></audio></figure><p >Enjoy more audio and podcasts on<!-- --> <a id="audio-ios-cta" href="https://www.economist.comhttps://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1239397626?pt=344884&amp;ct=article%20audio%20player&amp;mt=8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">iOS</a> <!-- -->or<!-- --> <a id="audio-android-cta" href="https://www.economist.comhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.economist.lamarr&amp;referrer=utm_source%3Darticle%2520audio%2520player" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Android</a>.</p></div><p >Neither is giving up. Consider Mr Netanyahu, whose party, Likud, won the most seats in an election on March 23rd, but whose right-wing coalition lacks a majority in the Knesset, Israel’s parliament. For the past three weeks he has tried—and failed—to convince other parties to support his bloc. Mr Netanyahu even reached out (via intermediaries) to Ra’am, an Islamist party. His main target, though, has been Naftali Bennett, the leader of Yamina, a nationalist party that is similar to Likud. Mr Bennett, who was once Mr Netanyahu’s chief of staff, says “the door to a right-wing government is open.”</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p >But Mr Bennett has also begun negotiating with parties opposed to Mr Netanyahu. They, too, lack a majority—and they have little in common, apart from their contempt for the prime minister. In order to form a government they would need the support of at least one Arab-Israeli party. Mr Bennett doesn’t like that. He is being wooed by Yair Lapid, leader of the centrist Yesh Atid party and architect of the anti-Netanyahu coalition. Mr Lapid, whose party holds many more seats than Yamina, is willing to let Mr Bennett serve as prime minister first if they form a government.</p><p >With his leadership on the line, Mr Netanyahu is flailing. He has called for a direct election of the prime minister, while his supporters attack Mr Bennett. On April 27th Mr Netanyahu tried to appoint a member of Likud as justice minister, a move that was deemed illegal by the attorney-general as it violated the agreement that created the current government. After Israel’s Supreme Court suspended the appointment, Mr Netanyahu backed down and gave the post to Benny Gantz.</p><p >As leader of the centrist Blue and White party, Mr Gantz agreed to team up with Mr Netanyahu after the last election, in 2020. Their deal gave Blue and White control of the justice ministry. It would also make Mr Gantz prime minister later this year if no new government is formed and no new election is held. Mr Gantz now wants to get rid of Mr Netanyahu one way or another.</p><p >Mr Netanyahu had two big reasons for seeking control of the justice ministry. First, he is on trial for corruption, charges he would like to see go away.Second, by provoking a showdown Mr Netanyahu was able to renew his criticism of the Supreme Court. It acts like an unelected “super-government”, he says. He may have thought this would make it more difficult for Mr Bennett, a critic of the court, to work with parties that support it. But the move seems to have spurred those trying to unseat the prime minister. “Israel has reached the edge of anarchy” and “needs a functioning and stable government,” said Mr Bennett, without singling out Mr Netanyahu.</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p >As for the Palestinians, stability is not a problem: they have held fewer elections in the past three decades than Israel has in the past two years. Mr Abbas was elected to a four-year term in 2005 and has since fiddled the maths. A parliamentary vote in 2006 saw Hamas, a militant Islamist group, gain a majority of seats. It subsequently took control of Gaza and remains estranged from Mr Abbas’s Fatah, the nationalist party that rules the West Bank. There have been no elections since.</p><p >This long democratic drought was meant to end on May 22nd, when Palestinians would finally choose a new legislature. Presidential elections would follow in July. To no one’s great surprise, though, those elections now seem likely to be shelved. On April 29th Mr Abbas cancelled the parliamentary poll.</p><p >He blamed Israel. The Oslo accords obligate it to let Palestinians vote at post offices in East Jerusalem, the Arab part of the city Israel captured in 1967. Less than a month before the vote, Israel has not confirmed it will allow this. On April 17th police arrested three Palestinian candidates who tried to hold a news conference in East Jerusalem. Tensions are also running high between the city’s Jewish and Palestinian residents. Israeli police and young Palestinian protesters clashed on April 22nd after a march of Jewish supremacists organised by far-right groups aligned with Mr Netanyahu’s coalition.</p><p >Mr Abbas declares Jerusalem a “red line”: if there cannot be elections in the city, there will be no elections at all. If this is a legitimate grievance, it is also a convenient pretext. Proposals have been made to hold elections in Jerusalem without Israel’s help. Mr Abbas does not wish to hear them. He is grateful for an excuse to cancel a ballot he may lose.</p><p >The president once said he would shoot anyone from Fatah who broke away to join a new party. He will need lots of ammunition. Two splinter factions have emerged in the run-up to the election. One of them, the Freedom party, is led by Nasser al-Qudwa, a nephew of the late Yasser Arafat, a revered Palestinian leader. Mr Qudwa joined forces with Marwan Barghouti, a veteran Fatah leader serving five life sentences in an Israeli prison. A second splinter group, the Future party, is affiliated with Muhammad Dahlan, a former Palestinian security boss now living in exile in Abu Dhabi.</p><p >A survey in March by Palestine’s leading pollster found that Fatah would win no more than 32% of the vote for parliament. It could be eclipsed by both the breakaway parties and Hamas. The numbers look equally grim for Mr Abbas in a presidential ballot: he would lose in a landslide against Mr Barghouti, should the latter run from prison, and it would be a toss-up against Ismail Haniyeh, the leader of Hamas.</p><p >Israel has no desire to see Hamas win another election (they have fought three small wars since 2009). Its interests align with those of Mr Abbas, who sees the group as a threat to his grip on power. Even if the vote is cancelled, though, that grip is weakening. He is 85 and recently flew to Germany for unspecified medical tests. The run-up to the elections exposed fractures within his ruling party; cancelling them would validate criticism of his self-interested authoritarian style. Both he and Mr Netanyahu have come to seem permanent fixtures of politics in the Holy Land. Their desperate eleventh-hour stunts are a reminder that they are not. <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p><p ><em>Editor’s note (April 30th 2021): This article was updated after the cancellation of the Palestinian parliamentary election.</em></p><p data-test-id="Footnote" >This article appeared in the Middle East &amp; Africa section of the print edition under the headline &quot;Past their sell-by date&quot;</p>
