For children at boarding school it brought birthday greetings, postcards from granny or blue aerogrammes from far-flung parents. Schoolchildren would fling themselves on these paper scraps: the lucky recipients clutched their bounty to their chests while the not so fortunate crept away, desolate.</p><p >Never were these responses more acute than in the final weeks of November, when the days were growing shorter and the envelopes ever bigger. This was the moment when mothers and fathers sent their children Advent calendars. The ritual countdown that began with opening the first window on December 1st has always been particularly poignant for boarders: it marks not just the countdown to Christmas, but the countdown to the end of term.</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p >Like many Christmas traditions that have become common in the West, Advent calendars have their roots in Germany. In the early 19th century German Protestants used to herald the season of Advent by putting a lit candle or a religious image each night in a window, or by making a chalk mark on their front door. The first printed calendars, created by Gerhard Lang, appeared in 1908. He remembered how in his childhood his mother used to sew 24 <em>wibele</em> (small sweet biscuits) onto the lid of a box and how he was allowed to eat one each day in the run-up to Christmas Eve. He later added doors to his design and, in the mid-1920s, Stollwerck chocolates. </p><p >Lang’s business collapsed in 1940 due to the rationing of paper during the second world war as well as new competition. It was another German printer, Richard Sellmer, who in 1945 took the Advent calendar to children the world over. He established connections with American buyers at trade fairs and invited political leaders to his publishing house in Stuttgart. (The company is still manufacturing calendars, shipping millions every year to more than 30 countries.) As the traditional offerings—of Bible verses, pictures of St Nicholas, the guiding star or the nativity scene—gave way to other treats, it may have been inevitable that the idea would take off, not just for adults as well as children but in the scope of the delights on offer. </p><figure><div itemscope="" itemProp="image" itemType="https://schema.org/ImageObject" data-slim="0"><meta itemProp="url" content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/720/90/sites/default/files/20201205_BKP504.jpg"/><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/720/90/sites/default/files/20201205_BKP504.jpg"  sizes="(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw" alt=""/></div></figure><p >In 2019 YouGov found that 49% of Britons were planning to treat themselves to a luxury calendar, with 6% opting for alcohol and 7% choosing foods other than chocolate. Wedgwood, an English fine china manufacturer, offers delicate tree decorations; Lovehoney, an adult store, provides sex toys to “make the build up to Christmas even more exciting”. In 2014 Liberty, a luxury department store in London, launched a beauty calendar containing items worth almost £800 ($1,000)—it is now the fastest-selling product in the shop’s 145-year history. To celebrate its centenary in 2019, Beaverbrooks, a British jewellers, launched a “diamond-a-day” Advent calendar at the discounted rate of £100,000. Not to be outdone, Tiffany launched a 1.2-metre tall blue box, stuffed with watches, bracelets and trinkets. Yours for a mere $112,000.</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p >Covid-19—and an increased emphasis on the environmental impact of Christmas—may put a stop to all that. In marketing bumf, words such as “lavish” have given way to an emphasis on the “sustainable” and the “reusable”. Some consumers, turning away from accumulating ever more stuff, may prefer to make their own Advent calendars this year, or even design one from scratch so that it exactly matches their child’s interests and personality. A welter of craft websites offer suggestions and tips, from hand-sewing small pockets to “upcycling” old boxes and jars. </p><p >Your correspondent has two particular recommendations. The first is a beautiful hand-illustrated cloth offering from l’Occitane, a French brand, which can be brought out again next year. Full of scented creams, mists and oils, it is perfect for frazzled parents who are in need of a long hot soak at the end of the day. The other is from OTO, which promises “moments that amplify the silence and allow you to tune in on what matters”. The magic ingredient in all the products is CBD, cannabidiol oil derived from marijuana. You get more bong for your buck as well as a peaceful, joyful Christmas.</p>
