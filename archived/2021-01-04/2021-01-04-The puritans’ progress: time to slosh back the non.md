When lockdown came into force, the gourmandising abruptly halted. Unable to go out carousing I became a cocktail aficionado, keen to recreate some of the pleasures of bar-hopping by perfecting my Negronis and Mojitos at home. A Gimlet? Yes please. And why not try a Nuclear Daiquiri, in which rum and lime turn radioactive under the influence of green Chartreuse?</p><p >The thrill wore off not long before my liver turned to pâté. As the parent of a rambunctious two-year-old, I could afford only so many bleary mornings. Denied the joy of being out on the town, the drinking seemed less pleasingly indulgent. And so, like many of my friends, I retreated from bibulous excess into a “sober curious” phase, quietly rethinking my relationship with alcohol.</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p >A regime of elderflower cordial and kombucha soon began to feel limiting. Then, at the back of my drinks cupboard I found a lonely bottle of Seedlip, sometimes described as an “alt gin” – looks like a spirit, bottled like a spirit, but without the alcohol.</p><p >Mixing a counterfeit Martini, I found it unexpectedly pleasant to linger over. I’d previously dismissed the fast-growing tribe of low-alcohol drinks as overpriced and underpowered. I realised it was time to start paying attention.</p><p ><span data-caps="initial">B</span>y the time lockdown relaxed I was ready to lay on a tasting session. One evening I sat in the garden with a couple of friends sampling my new discoveries. First I served El Dorados, muddling sugar syrup and lemon juice with Caleño, a gin-inspired tropical infusion which has the tangy sweetness of inca berries. Spritzes followed, garnished with fat slices of orange: a splash of soda water brought out the bay leaf and grapefruit flavours of Æcorn Bitter, a non-alcoholic aperitif that draws its inspiration from 17th-century herbal remedies.</p><p >I mixed Old Fashioneds using Feragaia, a light but smoky Scottish creation. One friend picked out the taste of camomile, seaweed and lemon verbena, and was quick to request a refill: “You might think this kind of stuff’s a gimmick, but someone’s going to make a killing.”</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p >He’s right. These drinks, and others like them, are the creation of a new wave of entrepreneurs who are seeking to reinvent social occasions and the liquids we use to grease their wheels. “Low-alc” spirits contain no more alcohol (0.5%) than the overripe banana you might mash up for a smoothie. The ambition is to sell a product that is compatible with sobriety, but commands the respect and perpetuates the rituals that we reserve for drinks such as whisky or gin.</p><p >Many people are becoming less interested in getting drunk. Increasingly they thirst for a unique experience, and see drink as an enhancer rather than an essential social lubricant. What matters isn’t a liquid’s alcoholic payload but its capacity to elevate a mood or moment.</p><figure data-image-nozoom="true"><div itemscope="" itemProp="image" itemType="https://schema.org/ImageObject"><meta itemProp="url" content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/1280/90/1843magazine.com/sites/default/files/20201216_NonSpirits02x1280.jpg"/><img loading="lazy" width="1280" height="1280" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/1280/90/1843magazine.com/sites/default/files/20201216_NonSpirits02x1280.jpg"  sizes="(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw" alt=""/></div></figure><p >Year Zero for the low-alc sector was 2014. That was when Ben Branson (no relation of Richard) launched Seedlip. I remember being eager to sample its Spice and Garden versions – one was redolent of cloves, the other of peas – but I was unconvinced that I should pay £26 ($35) for a bottle, much the same price as a decent gin, which includes a hefty slug of duty (£8 of every 70cl of standard-strength spirits sold in Britain goes to the taxman).</p><p >Yet as I dabbled in virgin-cocktail making, I found that different mixers brought out more refined flavours. My scepticism started to dissolve, though not to the point where I could say I was a devotee. Seedlip was clearly onto something, inspiring Cosnopolitans and Nogronis. Where it led others have followed.</p><blockquote><p>I retreated from bibulous excess into a “sober curious” phase, quietly rethinking my relationship with alcohol</p></blockquote><p >In Britain there are now more than 50 upstart products promising a glorious Third Way between “drinking” and “not drinking”. Their number is growing in other countries too. The funding often comes from Big Booze. Diageo, a global beverage giant, backs Distill Ventures, which invests in and advises new drinks companies. It’s a prudently defensive measure: in 2020 sales of low-alcohol spirits in Britain rose by 20% in value on the previous year and the “no and low” sector as a whole was up by 30%.</p><p >Younger people – millennials and Gen Z – are in the vanguard of the puritans’ progress. Among them is 29-year-old Ellie Webb, who launched Caleño in 2018 after noticing that some of her friends were worrying about hangovers affecting their productivity. Other people she knew feared that their “personal brand” – as presented on social media – could be undermined by alcohol-induced missteps.</p><p >Given the target market, companies such as Caleño emphasise their own branding. Most aim to be Instagram-friendly – clean-cut but cool, like their imbibers. Many try to tap into the social consciousness of Generation Z, cutting across traditional gender divides and design values that often reinforce them.</p><figure data-image-nozoom="true"><div itemscope="" itemProp="image" itemType="https://schema.org/ImageObject"><meta itemProp="url" content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/1280/90/1843magazine.com/sites/default/files/20201216_NonSpirits03x1280.jpg"/><img loading="lazy" width="1280" height="1280" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/1280/90/1843magazine.com/sites/default/files/20201216_NonSpirits03x1280.jpg"  sizes="(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw" alt=""/></div></figure><p >Jamie Wild of Feragaia offers an unusual piece of business wisdom: “Follow the vegans.” Until a couple of years ago that wouldn’t have been a motto to tempt the venture capitalists. But the cliché of the joyless hippie who survives on a diet of lentils is a thing of the past. Today’s vegans can dine on crabless crab cakes, meatless bacon or steaks made from moulded wheat protein. And they’re prepared to pay handsomely for such items. Beyond Meat, a Californian company, sells a plant-based burger that “bleeds” beetroot juice. At £5 for a two-pack in a supermarket they cost more than many premium beef patties they are engineered to imitate.</p><p >The parallels between veganism and low-alc are clear. Yet there are differences. Whereas vegans shun meat altogether, the pioneers of low-alc tend not to be anti-alcohol. Paul Mathew, the brains behind a bittersweet aperitif called Everleaf, favours moderation and choice. “I was running bars”, he tells me, “and more and more people were coming in wanting low-alcohol or alcohol-free drinks, but we didn’t have anything that had much complexity.” He aimed to create a sophisticated product with a satisfying mouth-feel – what he calls a “smooth evolution of flavour on the palate”.</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-3"></div></div></div><p >The resulting drink is flavoured with vanilla and saffron, but it’s the time it lingers in the mouth that makes it distinctive – and more like an alcoholic drink than the “soft” alternative we might usually be offered. Everleaf includes gentian and iris, which deliver a combination of bitterness and warmth. Its pleasingly viscous texture owes a lot to konjac, which was previously familiar to me only as a material used to make bath sponges.</p><blockquote><p>A popular alternative to hard drinks needs to capture the physical characteristics and psychological climate of consuming alcohol</p></blockquote><p >Such attributes matter. To develop a popular alternative to hard drinks you need to capture some of the physical characteristics – the way a drink tastes, feels and looks – and psychological climate of consuming alcohol. Alcohol induces relaxation, mild euphoria and an untying of the tongue. The challenge for low-alcohol spirits is to replicate enough of these behaviours to persuade us that we’re having a special experience and stop us thinking that we might as well glug cranberry juice.</p><figure data-image-nozoom="true"><div itemscope="" itemProp="image" itemType="https://schema.org/ImageObject"><meta itemProp="url" content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/1280/90/1843magazine.com/sites/default/files/20201216_NonSpirits04x1280.jpg"/><img loading="lazy" width="1280" height="1280" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/1280/90/1843magazine.com/sites/default/files/20201216_NonSpirits04x1280.jpg"  sizes="(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw" alt=""/></div></figure><p ><span data-caps="initial">O</span>ne of the pleasures I derive from a drink is the conversation it fuels about itself. Over the last decade the vocabulary available for such conversation has grown, thanks partly to the renaissance of British gin-makers who use a wealth of botanicals and craft techniques. This has paved the way for the new low-alc producers to talk up their authenticity and weave a story about their ingredients and provenance.</p><p >Some ingredients have taken centre stage for health reasons. Many consumers want to enrich their diet with ingredients that promise higher energy levels, better gut health or reduced risk of illness. Names that a few years ago met with a blank look – ashwagandha, cassia bark, yerba mate – are now rallying points for a new generation of clean-living cognoscenti.</p><p >Three Spirit is a drinks firm that stresses the importance of function as much as flavour in its drinks: “designed by plant scientists and bartenders”, runs the tagline, in a slightly gothic font intended to recall the “alchemy” of yesteryear. To charge such high prices – each 50cl bottle costs £25 – you can’t simply make empty promises about miracle tonics. The company is keen to substantiate the health-giving properties of its products: Dash Lilley, its co-founder, has been working with Michael Heinrich, an expert on health foods and medicinal plants at University College London.</p><p >Lilley already uses 60 ingredients across just three products, and there are plenty of others he’s keen to work into new creations, such as Californian poppy and olive leaf. Novelty is important. “Part of the mission of the brand”, he says, “is to introduce people to wonderful ingredients they haven’t come across.”</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-4"></div></div></div><p >He could be speaking for the whole sector. The best of these drinks don’t merely imitate “the real thing”, they provide something new and interesting in their own right. As I improvise low-alcohol cocktails for my friends, I notice that they are indeed enjoying disentangling their drinks’ subtleties. At the end of the evening, I serve neat shots of Three Spirit’s Nightcap. On the palate it’s half spice, half velvet: maple syrup and birch sap along with hints of ginger, Sichuan pepper and turmeric.</p><p >When my friends have gone, I enjoy another generous measure. The text on the bottle mentions valerian and hops; I know there’s ashwagandha, too, which is supposed to be calming. Though perfectly sober, I soon find the velvet is getting the better of the spice and feel compelled to lie full-length on the sofa. It’s true, I think, as a blanket of drowsiness spreads over me: you might think this kind of stuff’s a gimmick, but someone’s going to make a killing.<span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p><p >ILLUSTRATIONS: <strong>PAUL WEARING</strong></p>
