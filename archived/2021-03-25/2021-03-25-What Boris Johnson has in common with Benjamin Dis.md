Mr Johnson models himself on Churchill, but even his most ardent fans recognise the absurdity of the comparison given his hero’s unique wartime role. He has far more in common with Disraeli.</p><p >Like Disraeli, Mr Johnson is an outsider, never really trusted by that mysterious but very real entity: “the establishment”. Disraeli, the grandson of a Jewish-Italian immigrant who sold straw hats, was the only 19th-century prime minister not to attend a public school or Oxbridge. At first glance, Mr Johnson’s background looks quite different. He was “stuffed to the gills with the finest education England could offer” at Eton and Balliol College, Oxford, as he put it, but he is more exotic than this suggests. The descendant of Turks, who experienced a peripatetic childhood amid chaotic family circumstances, he treats the British ruling class with a combination of contempt and deference similar to Disraeli’s.</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p >Disraeli could never resist the temptation to poke fun at the priggish and pompous, who were hardly in short supply in Victorian England. He mocked his first patron, Peel, for long-windedness (“he traces the steam engine always back to the tea-kettle”), and his great rival, Gladstone, for self-righteousness. Mr Johnson loves taking a pop at neo-Victorians, whether the great and the good spouting platitudes or woke warriors itching to take offence.</p><p >Both men conquered the establishment by turning themselves into brands. Disraeli dressed like a dandy when he was young, favouring a bottle-green jacket, blue trousers and rainbow waistcoat; as prime minister he arranged his hair in a trademark curl on his forehead. Mr Johnson developed his distinctive persona—tousled blond hair, Bertie Wooster manner and rumpled clothes—at school and has been milking it ever since.</p><p >Both were hopeless with money. Disraeli’s first big investment was such a disaster that he didn’t clear his debts until he was prime minister. His 14 novels were written at speed to keep the wolf from the door, and, at his lowest ebb, the jailers at bay. One of the things that attracted him to Parliament was that <small>MP</small>s couldn’t be imprisoned for bankruptcy. And one of the most treasured consequences of political fame was that he could sell a lot more books: during a spell as chancellor he produced a complete edition of his novels, which sold 300,000 copies in a year.</p><p >Mr Johnson’s habits of casting off wives (two so far) and siring children (at least six) make it tricky balancing income and spending. He is having such difficulty surviving on his prime-ministerial salary of £162,000 that he and his girlfriend, Carrie Symonds, are contemplating the very Disraelian ploy of setting up a charity, funded by rich donors, to redecorate their Downing Street flat.</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p >The most damaging charge against the two men is that they risked their country’s fortunes (“success is the child of Audacity” says one of Disraeli’s characters) to feed their egos. Disraeli destroyed Peel’s reforming government only to adopt his predecessor’s policies of free trade and religious toleration as prime minister. Mr Johnson embraced Brexit at least in part because he thought that it would ease his path to the top. But beneath the shape-shifting, two themes run through the politics of both men.</p><p >The first is the nation-state. Disraeli saw European politics as a clash between the rival principles of “nationalism” and “cosmopolitanism”, and argued consistently that the Conservative Party was a “national party” or nothing. That meant celebrating the empire with all due pomp and circumstance and solving the problem of the “two nations” that he had identified in his novel “Sybil”, by promoting harmony between the classes.</p><p >Historians, being nit-pickers by trade, have taken to questioning Disraeli’s commitment to “one-nation Toryism”, pointing out that he had a habit of falling asleep when social reforms were mentioned. But this ignores the importance of his second great political theme: imagination. He thought that politics was less about drafting laws than about spinning stories. He seldom gave a speech without mentioning Britain’s glorious past or conjuring up its even more splendid future. And he was so successful in envisioning a “national party” that his successors dedicated themselves to turning it into a reality. In April 1883 the <em>Times</em> credited him with being the first to discern “the Conservative working man as the sculptor perceives the angel prisoned in a block of marble”. In the same year the Tories created the mass-membership Primrose League, named after his favourite flower, to appeal to the newly expanded electorate with a socialism-slaying combination of hierarchy, empire and social reform.</p><p >Mr Johnson treats the European Union as the perfect cosmopolitan foil: a self-consciously post-national institution that combines grand aspirations with pettifogging bureaucracy. But he also understands that the Tories cannot merely demonise the opposition. They have to demonstrate that the nation-state can solve people’s problems, by increasing funding for the health service and persuading those who feel left behind by the smug, prosperous south-east that they are valued members of the community. He follows Disraeli’s example in making up for a shortage of detail with a surplus of imagination: his speeches are an amalgam of references to past glories and vague promises to create a space programme or build a bridge from Scotland to Northern Ireland. It may be empty stuff, but it appeals to present-day “angels in marble”—former Labour voters who are tired of hearing their country demonised as a nursery of genocide and slavery.</p><p >Randolph Churchill, Winston’s father and a posthumous follower of Disraeli’s, provided a lapidary summary of his hero’s career: “failure, failure, failure, partial success, renewed failure, ultimate and complete triumph”. Mr Johnson’s fortunes have been similarly volatile so far. The ultimate verdict on him may be triumph or disaster, but it is unlikely to be in between.<span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p><p data-test-id="Footnote" >This article appeared in the Britain section of the print edition under the headline &quot;Dizzy rascal&quot;</p><br><hr><div>获取更多RSS：<br><a href="https://feedx.net" style="color:orange" target="_blank">https://feedx.net</a> <br><a href="https://feedx.top" style="color:orange" target="_blank">https://feedx.top</a><br></div>
