Light bulbs move along an assembly line, dancing from machine tool to machine tool, through a wall of soldering fire, onto a conveyor belt and into the arms of a line of wistful young factory workers who wear eyeliner and lipstick even on the factory floor. In a second sequence, the factory workers dress up as their dreams. One is a ballerina with angel wings; others are tap dancers, electric guitarists or masters of tai chi. Ms Cao is never overtly critical, but a sense of suspicion about the underside of capitalism and globalisation pervades all her work. On the soundtrack of “Whose Utopia?” a thin voice sings: “Part of your life had waned and waned, but to whom do you beautifully belong?”</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p >The child of a well-known sculptor who taught at the Guangzhou Academy of Fine Arts in southern China, Ms Cao was born in 1978, the same year Deng Xiaoping launched the economic reforms that would spark the country’s rise. Growing up in Guangdong province, she was exposed from an early age to the influences seeping in through China’s southern border: television and Cantopop from Hong Kong, Japanese anime, American hip-hop. Her work also incorporates themes of Chinese youth culture, utopia and dystopia and the effects of technology, which all helped bring her to the attention of Western curators. From 2003, when she was still only 25, some of the world’s most important contemporary-art galleries began to show her work: MoMA PS1 in New York, the Serpentine and Tate Modern in London, and the Venice Biennale three times.</p><p >Ms Cao’s UCCA show, “Staging the Era”, will be the first in China to cover her whole career. Mr Tinari’s ambitions for it are clear: “Our audiences are interested in one question: why is she as prominent as she is?” And his answer is simple: “I think she’s the greatest explainer of China to the outside world.”<span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p><p ><em>This article appeared in the Culture section of the print edition of The World in 2021 under the headline “Explaining China”</em></p>
