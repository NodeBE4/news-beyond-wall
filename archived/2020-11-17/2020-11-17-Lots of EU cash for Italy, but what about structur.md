By summer the first tranche is due of the cash the European Commission is raising to help EU member states recover from the effects of covid-19. Italy will get a disproportionately large share: according to the government, €209bn ($250bn) in grants and loans, out of a total of €750bn.</p><p >Such a massive injection of liquidity would be unprecedented: not even the Marshall Plan, which transformed Italy’s fortunes after the second world war, delivered as much (taking into account the size of the economy and after factoring in inflation). Whether the EU’s recovery funds will have the same impact will depend on several factors.</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p >The first is whether the government’s estimate proves correct. The eventual allocation will depend partly on the size of the hit each country’s economy took from covid-19 restrictions. Halfway through 2020, Italy’s GDP was 17.3% below its level of a year earlier. That was worse than the EU average. But Italy still fared better than either Spain or France.</p><p >The second question is whether the authorities can devise the kinds of projects the European Commission can approve: the greener and more digital the better. And a third is whether the money that is allocated will all reach its intended destination. One of the aims will be to channel funding to the <em>mezzogiorno</em>, as the country’s south is known, in an effort to close the wealth gap with the richer north. Past efforts to achieve that have failed, in part because too much of the cash has ended up in the hands of Italy’s organised criminals, who are ominously well embedded in the legal economy.</p><p >But perhaps the most important question of all, when it comes to Italy’s future productivity, competitiveness and overall prosperity, is whether those in charge are ready to accompany the aid with the kind of painful structural reforms that the country has successfully fended off for more than two decades. That, in turn, will depend on politics.</p><p >The coalition of the prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, which includes the centre-left Democratic Party (PD) and the anti-establishment Five Star Movement (M5S), looks relatively durable, despite a fragile majority in the Senate, parliament’s upper house. But the M5S in particular has a weakness for nationalisation and the PD has historical and emotional ties to a labour movement that has successfully blocked attempts in the past to make Italy a more modern and efficient country.
