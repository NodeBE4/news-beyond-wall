He says it could take place alongside mid-term elections in June, when Mexicans will be voting for the 500 seats of the lower house of the national congress and, in almost half the 32 states, for their congresses and governors. </p><p >Whether the recall referendum goes ahead or not, the elections could spell trouble for Morena, the party AMLO founded. Mask-free and hug-happy, months into the pandemic, AMLO and his government have badly mishandled it. Mexico entered 2021 trailing only the United States, Brazil and India for the number of deaths from covid-19. (The government admits the official figure may be a gross underestimate.) As children elsewhere returned to school in September, Mexicans started television education.</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p >Mexicans are getting poorer, too. The economy is in its worst slump for 80 years. It probably shrank by at least 10% in 2020; more than 1.1m people lost their jobs between March and June. AMLO, a fiscal conservative, has continued to tout austerity, ignoring advice that he should ride out the covid-19 crisis with spending. Decisions taken before the pandemic hit, such as cancelling a new airport, worth $13bn and already half-built, have led to less investment and more capital flight.</p><p >Security is also worsening. In the first six months of 2020 Mexico registered a record 17,349 murders, a 1.7% increase on the same period in 2019—in other locked-down countries, crime fell. In June 2020 Mexicans were rattled by a drug gang’s assassination attempt against Mexico City’s police chief. It was unusually shocking both for being so brazen and for taking place in a posh area of the capital.</p><p >However, AMLO may not pay at the polls for his blunders. His approval rating dropped from 80% at the start of 2020 to around 60% by mid-year, and support for Morena has fallen, too. In May only 19% of people said they would definitely vote for the party in 2021, less than half the proportion in December 2018. </p><p >Yet AMLO’s appeal, like that of other populists globally, rests more on personality and patrimony than prowess. Many Mexicans see him as one of them: he stops to eat tacos at roadside stalls and mingles with workers. Others see him as their saviour. Many credit him with projects such as the expansion of pensions and training programmes for youth.</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p >AMLO’s clean reputation helps. Even his detractors admit that he is not personally corrupt, a rare quality among the country’s leaders. That has been conveniently highlighted by a huge continuing corruption scandal in which a former head of the state oil company has made serious accusations against high-level Mexican officials, including three former presidents.</p><p >The opposition parties could club together to wound Morena. So AMLO may emerge with less of a mandate and a diminished ability to proceed with his grandiose plan to purge corruption, erase wealth inequality and promote national self-sufficiency—dubbed ”a fourth transformation” of Mexico.</p><p >One outcome in 2021 is clear: as in many countries around the world, not least Mexico’s neighbour to the north, elections have little power to heal divisions amplified by a polarising head of state.<span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p><p ><em>This article appeared in the Americas section of the print edition of The World in 2021 under the headline “Taking it to the Mexican people”</em></p>
