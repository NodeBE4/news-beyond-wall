In the year after the 2020 census it is up to states—either through their legislatures or through special commissions—to redraw voting districts to adjust for population change. Where politicians or their appointees oversee this, they get a chance to gerrymander. By drawing lines craftily, such as by concentrating their own likely voters and dividing those of their opponents, they can lock in a partisan advantage that endures for ten years.</p><p >Last time around, Republican strategists did so skilfully. Democrats, clobbered by the Tea Party wave, did badly in elections for state legislatures and governors in 2010. Republicans won those easily in Midwestern swing states, such as Ohio, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, then got to decide on redistricting the following year. The result: such states have become some of the most grossly gerrymandered. In Wisconsin, for example, even if Democrats won 54% of the votes cast in legislative elections, Republicans could still expect to enjoy a nine-seat majority in the state assembly.</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p >This is not just unfair. It also encourages extremism. In gerrymandered seats the incumbent knows that the risk of losing in the general election is slight. The greater threat is from in-party primary challengers who typically appeal to the political extremes (mostly it is ardent party activists who turn out for primaries). Less gerrymandering this time, therefore, could help encourage moderates in both parties.</p><figure><div itemscope="" itemProp="image" itemType="https://schema.org/ImageObject" data-slim="0"><meta itemProp="url" content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/1497/90/sites/default/files/images/articles/20201124_usc002.png"/><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/1497/90/sites/default/files/images/articles/20201124_usc002.png"  sizes="(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw" alt=""/></div></figure><p >There had been hopes that in 2021 matters would swing back a bit. Democrats had expected to win over more state houses in 2020, for example, but their efforts badly flopped. In some places where Republicans still control the legislature, such as Wisconsin, Democrats now occupy the governor’s mansion, and can (usually) veto legislators’ redistricting plans if they are egregious. A clash there is likely as legislators and the governor squabble before the courts intervene. That will look ugly but could result in less lopsided districts.</p><p >Just as importantly, several states have cleaned up the process of drawing boundaries by pushing politicians aside. In 2018 voters in Michigan, for example, overwhelmingly backed a plan for an independent commission, for both congressional and state district maps. Arizona, California and Colorado have all introduced independent commissions. Iowa already has non-partisan staff drawing its maps. In Pennsylvania courts have redrawn maps that were deemed too partisan, which with luck will ensure that future efforts are more restrained. Two years ago Missouri opted to reform its system, but voters undid that change in November. Even so, at least in the Midwest, there will be less chance for skulduggery.</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p >Where will gerrymandering still happen? Keep an eye on two trends, suggests Michael Li, an expert in the subject at the Brennan Centre for Justice, a New York think-tank that focuses on law and policy. First, watch states where one party won the “trifecta”: control of the assembly, the state senate and the governor’s mansion. Republicans already have several and added two more, in New Hampshire and Montana, in November. And, second, see where sizeable population shifts are recorded, meaning that big changes to voting districts are due.</p><p >Democratic-run Illinois remains badly gerrymandered. More serious worries arise in fast-growing southern states, where Republicans often dominate all wings of government. Race is usually an underlying issue—maps are redrawn to weaken the influence of African-American and other non-white voters (who are more reliably Democratic). Conditions are ripe for bad behaviour in Florida, Georgia and Texas—and in North Carolina, where the governor cannot veto redistricting plans.</p><p >It is unlikely that a divided Congress would agree on federal plans to improve redistricting for all, but it could push for national standards both for congressional districts and for state legislative ones. Three representatives from California proposed such a bill in 2019. Congress has acted before. In 1842 it ordered that a district could have only one representative, for example. Nearly two centuries on, it might be time for it to act again.<span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p><p ><em>This article appeared in the United States section of the print edition of The World in 2021 under the headline “Winning the next ten years”</em></p>
