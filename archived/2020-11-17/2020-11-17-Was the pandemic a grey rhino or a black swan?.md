For years, many governments brushed off countless credible warnings that the world was poorly prepared for a pandemic. When the novel coronavirus emerged in China, too many nations were too slow to respond.</p><p >The pandemic should encourage policymakers to pay more attention to other known but poorly managed risks. These include rising inequality, climate change and financial imbalances such as dangerous corporate-debt levels and asset bubbles. Picture each of these obvious dangers as a two-tonne grey rhinoceros with its horn pointed our way and its massive weight bearing down on us: they are very visible and their impact can be foreseen. The interactions among these rhinos heighten the danger. You could appropriately call them a crash­—the zoological term for a group—of grey rhinos.</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p >Politicians, pundits and investors often invoke the metaphor of the “black swan” to describe highly improbable, even unimaginable events. In particular, the global financial crisis of 2007-09 is often described as a black-swan event, despite warnings about derivatives and a subprime housing-market bubble. By definition, black swans cannot be predicted, so nothing can be done to prepare for them. This kind of thinking makes things worse by encouraging fatalism, rejecting accountability and giving the nod to short-termism and wilful ignor­ance, which in turn generate volatility and tail risk. To face the looming risks of 2021, we must replace black-swan fatalism with grey-rhino constructive pragmatism.</p><p >As covid-19 spread, analysts quickly downgraded their early pandemic predictions of a fast V-shaped recovery to a slower U-shaped recovery, and then to an even more gradual “swoosh”. We now have a k-shaped recovery that has given the well-to-do a big boost, creating financial-asset bubbles while essential workers and vulnerable sectors struggle. In 2021 the global economy will suffer from a ripple effect of bankruptcies, job losses and defaults, which stockmarkets cannot ignore for ever. At the same time, increasingly violent storms, droughts, wildfires and freak weather will threaten insurers, property, coastal cities and, by extension, financial stability.</p><p >Facing the daunting challenges ahead will require long-term thinking, a greater emphasis on the real economy rather than stockmarket performance and, above all, a commitment to hold ourselves and our leaders accountable. But it also presents new opportunities. Removing fossil-fuel subsidies and promoting investment in clean technologies will create jobs and reduce energy and health-care costs. Tackling inequality will lift the bottom leg of the k-shaped recovery and spread the benefits of the economic rebound.</p><p >We can see black swans only in the rear-view mirror. In 2021 we should focus on the grey rhinos in front of us: obvious, foreseeable and giving us a choice to respond.<span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p ><em>Michele Wucker is the author of “You Are What You Risk: The New Art and Science of Navigating an Uncertain World” (Pegasus Books, April 2021) and “The Gray Rhino: How to Act and Recognize the Obvious Dangers We Ignore” (St Martin’s Press, 2016)</em></p><p ><em>This article appeared in the Aftershocks section of the print edition of The World in 2021 under the headline “A black swan?
