And will the resentment of the many losers from the covid-19 crisis translate into destabilising support for extremist forces? These are the big questions facing the country in 2021.</p><p >A long and severe lockdown, the wiping-out of the tourist season, disruption caused by renewed outbreaks of covid-19 and less fiscal firepower than some of its neighbours all conspired to plunge the country into a deep recession. The economy shrank by around 12% in 2020 with the loss of 1m jobs. Recovery has begun but it is complicated by a strong resurgence of the virus and renewed restrictions on leisure activities.</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p >The recovery is also lopsided. Spain is unusually dependent on tourism (12.3% of GDP in 2019 ) and other face-to-face businesses. Nobody wants to go back to a generalised lockdown, but some regional governments will struggle to organise effective tracking, tracing and isolation of those infected with the virus.</p><p >In some ways life will become easier for the minority left-wing coalition government of Pedro Sánchez, the Socialist prime minister. A decision by Ciudadanos, a centre-right party, to rally round seems likely to help him pass a budget. He will hope to avoid having to reduce emergency aid to workers and businesses too soon. If things go well, the economy could grow by 7% or so in 2021. The government places high hopes in the €140bn ($165bn) it expects over time to get from the European recovery fund. Most of this will go on projects such as renewable energy, digitisation or reforms of training schemes that will yield benefits only in the medium term.</p><p >So far Spaniards have been admirably stoical. But as they endure the second economic shock in a decade their patience may wear thin. The previous crisis gave birth to Podemos, a far-left party that is now the junior partner in the government. The current one may boost Vox, a hard-right party which became the third-biggest force in parliament in elections in 2019. Despite falling support for independence in Catalonia, the separatist parties there will hope to benefit from the apathy of their opponents in a regional election due on February 14th.</p><p >Mr Sánchez will muddle through. If the economy recovers strongly and the pandemic recedes he could call a snap election before the inevitable fiscal adjustment of 2022. His Socialists would hope to make gains at the expense mainly of Podemos. However, the likelihood is that Spain faces more years of weak government.<span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p ><em>This article appeared in the Europe section of the print edition of The World in 2021 under the headline “More pain in Spain”</em></p>
