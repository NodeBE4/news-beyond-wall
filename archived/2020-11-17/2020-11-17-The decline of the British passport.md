This was because it allowed its lucky holders visa-free access to more places than any other country’s passport. In 2016 it dropped from first to third position, and has since slid further (see chart). In 2020—the year it reverted to its traditional blue cover—it fell to seventh. In 2021 this gentle decline in its power will become a plunge. </p><p >The biggest reason is Brexit (which was also one of the reasons for the change in colour). Britain has enjoyed many of the privileges of an EU member state during its post-Brexit transition period, which ends on December 31st 2020. Britons will not require visas to visit the 27 remaining member states after that, but they will lose the right to live, work or study there, and will face limits on how long they can stay without paperwork. They will have to fill in a form and pay a small fee once the EU puts in place its American-style pre-authorisation system, which is due to launch in 2022. They will also find it harder to take pets into the EU. </p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p >A big factor influencing visa regimes is the wealth of a country’s tourists. British travellers are a high-spending bunch, and will still be sought after around the world. The main reason the British passport slipped down the rankings over the past few years is not that some countries shut their doors to Britons, but that they opened their doors to others. Holders of Singaporean, South Korean and Japanese passports are increasingly welcome in more countries than Brits or other Europeans. </p><figure><div itemscope="" itemProp="image" itemType="https://schema.org/ImageObject" data-slim="0"><meta itemProp="url" content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/457/90/sites/default/files/images/articles/20201124_brc001.png"/><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/457/90/sites/default/files/images/articles/20201124_brc001.png"  sizes="(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw" alt=""/></div></figure><p >Yet geopolitics and trade affect visa policies too. Political tensions with China, Iran and Russia trickle down to ordinary travellers. Moreover, countries like Germany, Japan and South Korea are economic powerhouses that make lots of things. Other countries value economic relationships with them, and visa-free travel can be a spur to greater trade. But Britain, which has a strong services sector, “is no longer a major player in terms of finished goods and that has an effect on the perception of the UK,” says Paddy Blewer of Henley &amp; Partners. As a result, “other sovereign states are less willing to give it visa-free travel.” Nor is Britain particularly generous when it comes to granting visa-free access to its own shores to citizens of non-Western states. That creates resentment. </p><p >The pandemic will not help. Even as borders closed across the world, EU states continued to treat Britain as a member. But after the transition period Britain will be treated like any other country, and access to the rest of Europe will be conditional on keeping infection rates low. Outside Europe, few countries make special exceptions for British citizens. Britain’s new, weaker position in the world will make reciprocal visa policies a part of new negotiations. Some Brits may feel pride at the return of the blue passport, but it will not be nearly as widely welcomed as the old burgundy one.<span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p ><em>This article appeared in the Britain section of the print edition of The World in 2021 under the headline “Decline and fall”</em></p>
