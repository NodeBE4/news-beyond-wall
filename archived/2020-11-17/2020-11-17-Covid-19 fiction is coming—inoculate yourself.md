Rivals hack into his computer; a rogue state tries to assassinate him using a gun disguised as a digital thermometer. He escapes, only to be struck down by the disease. Secretly besotted with him, the scientist’s assistant finishes the job, saving him and the world.</p><p >Gazing across the street from her balcony, a woman spots a man she has never seen before. They synchronise their evening appearances and, in the darkest days of the virus, their socially distanced love blossoms. At last, overcome with passion, they rush down to the street to embrace—and are arrested for violating the lockdown.</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p >The writing and publishing of novels is a slow business, which means that stories cooked up during the pandemic, and inspired by it, will mostly be published in 2021. Some may feature plots not unlike those imagined above. These books will shed light, if sometimes inadvertently, on the craft of storytelling and the nuanced relationship between fiction and the news.</p><p >The trouble with setting novels during recent events is not only that other writers will be doing the same; it is that readers have lived through the whole pandemic themselves and might, to put it mildly, be in the mood for different themes. Even if some readers are inclined to revisit the horrors of the coronavirus outbreak, original insights will be hard to come by.</p><p >Convulsive as it has been, and for all the life-and-death freneticism of hospitals, for many people the pandemic has been sedentary and isolated, involving a lot of television and plenty of baking. That is not the stuff of which page-turning dramas are made. And for any novelist who manages to surpass these obstacles, yet another authorial risk looms: if a real-life vaccine intervenes, all the masks and hand-sanitising stations woven into narratives might seem out of date before the books hit the shelves. </p><p >The best efforts will be subtler. Illness in fiction often serves as a metaphor for something else—moral blindness, say, or the contagion of extreme politics. Similarly, the most thoughtful contemporary authors will capture the impact of the virus in indirect ways and settings: a desert substituting for an empty city, or a prison cell for a lonely living room. They will convey the mood of the plague rather than its ephemeral details, and its lasting impact on relationships and psyches. Distilling all that requires time and distance. So although there are bound to be several in 2021, readers may have to wait a while for the definitive covid-19 novel.<span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p ><em>This article appeared in the Culture section of the print edition of The World in 2021 under the headline “A literary outbreak”</em></p><br><hr><div>获取更多RSS：<br><a href="https://feedx.net" style="color:orange" target="_blank">https://feedx.net</a> <br><a href="https://feedx.xyz" style="color:orange" target="_blank">https://feedx.xyz</a><br></div>
