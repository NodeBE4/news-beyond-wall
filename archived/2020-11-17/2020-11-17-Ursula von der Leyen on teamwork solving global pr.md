This is an illusion. The only race is against the virus and against time. We, as human beings, are fighting this together. Our best strategy is co-operation, and this has been the European Union’s approach from the very outset of the coronavirus crisis.</p><p >It usually takes up to ten years to develop, test and distribute a new vaccine. But the world cannot afford ten years of this pandemic—a decade of mourning, confinement and disruption. Every month we gain will save thousands of lives and millions of jobs. Dozens of research teams are now racing to develop vaccines. We need as many as possible to reach the finish line.</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p >This is all about geopolitical co-operation, not competition. It will not matter whether the first vaccine is Chinese, American or European. What truly matters is that the world gets a safe vaccine with the shortest delay, and that the most vulnerable are immunised first, wherever they are. Doctors, nurses, elderly people and essential workers should take precedence, whatever their nationality. This is the most efficient way to stem the pandemic and save lives. Vaccine nationalism—a “my country first” approach to immunisation—can only slow down the global fight against the virus.</p><p >Since the early days of the crisis the European Commission has worked to give health professionals a better chance to succeed, in our collective interest. When the initial outbreak morphed into a global pandemic, we swiftly joined forces with the World Health Organisation and other global-health actors, such as Gavi and CEPI, as well as businesses and civil-society groups. Together we launched an initiative to speed up the fight against the disease: the Access to Covid-19 Tools Accelerator.</p><p >Its vaccines pillar, called COVAX, brought together 170 countries with NGOs, business leaders and philanthropists, to create the largest portfolio of vaccine candidates in the world. The aim is to make sure that as many vaccines as possible reach the trial phase and, eventually, the market. Instead of competing against other countries, Europe is joining forces with them, so that we all increase our chances of success.</p><p >We do not do this out of altruism. We simply realise that our European interest coincides with a shared global interest. While engaging in talks with six pharmaceutical groups to purchase potential vaccines for European citizens, we are also working to reserve and finance doses for low-income countries through COVAX. For instance, when we signed advance-purchase agreements with Sanofi and GSK, we agreed they would reserve a significant portion of their vaccine supply for COVAX.</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p >This is how I see the European Union’s mission in today’s world. We have a unique asset—our convening power. As a union of 27 sovereign countries, we have an unparalleled diplomatic network. We are a trusted interlocutor for international organisations and NGOs. We can reach out to countries that will not even talk to each other, and rally them around a common cause. We are team-builders by vocation, and in the quest for a vaccine we have put our convening power at the service of all nations.</p><p >I want Europe to be a global leader—and true leaders are not those who leave everyone else behind. Leadership is about building large and strong coalitions towards a common goal. Take climate action. We have become a trailblazer in the transition towards a cleaner and more circular economy, and the European Green Deal will accelerate this transition. We have set the highest goals for ourselves: the European Union will cut its carbon emissions by at least 55% compared with 1990 levels by 2030, and we will be climate-neutral by 2050.</p><p >Yet the European Union accounts for less than 10% of global emissions. We cannot stop global warming alone. The good news is we are not alone. There is a global movement for climate action, one that can count on powerful nations but also on countless cities, local authorities and individuals. Europe wants to contribute to the movement and make it grow. We will form ambitious coalitions in the fight against climate change, deforestation and chemical pollution. On emissions trading, we are ready to work with all partners who also believe that carbon must have a price.</p><p >Our offer to the world is clear. Let us join forces for our common good. There is no time to lose. In 2021 will humanity finally play as a team? I do not know—but I do know where Europe will stand.<span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p><p ><em>This article appeared in the Europe section of the print edition of The World in 2021 under the headline “Team Europe, playing for the world”</em></p>
