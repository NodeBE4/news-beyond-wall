The money didn’t arrive for weeks, but Tomas was able to fall back on the guaranteed income of $500 a month that he’d been receiving since February 2019, as part of an experimental programme I’ve been piloting in Stockton, California. He spent this unconditional cash on rent, food and bills. Building on this income floor, he gave back to his community, providing free car-repair services to essential workers and donating supplies to the local fire station.</p><p >Though Tomas’s experience is specific to a once-in-a-generation pandemic, a sudden job loss for any other reason could also have forced him, and a majority of Americans, into eviction, food-bank lines, and crippling debt. Covid-19 has simply laid bare what has always been true: people are working, but the economy isn’t. Economic insecurity in America is widespread, and structural racism has maintained racial wealth and income disparities that make it impossible for people to thrive. Tomas’s story is one example of how an income floor can build economic resilience.</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p >All of our neighbours are worthy of an economic floor, particularly because emergencies and economic disruption have become the norm. It might be a pandemic today, but it could be a hurricane or fire tomorrow. In the wealthiest country in the world, it is uncivilised for people to be contributing to the economy and their communities and still fall below the poverty line. There is nothing inherently dignified in working two or three jobs, yet still being unable to afford the basics; or to be deemed an “essential worker”, but not be entitled to hazard pay, union protection, health insurance or personal protective equipment.</p><p >In the 1930s, the last American economic crisis of this scale was met by drastic social reform that brought about significant protection for workers, including the right to unionise and unemployment insurance. But in 2020 we need more. Unemployment insurance is necessary but insufficient, and even full-time employment does not mean economic security anymore. We need a social safety-net that goes beyond conditional benefits tied to employment, that works for everyone and begins to address the call for racial and economic justice.</p><p >In 2021 we will change course and build an economy that recognises the universal dignity of all people through a guaranteed income. Rooted in Martin Luther King’s economic dream, a guaranteed income—in the form of a monthly cash payment given directly to individuals—embodies government at its best, trusting our constituents and giving them the agency to make the right decisions for themselves and their families.</p><p >The Stockton guaranteed-income programme, which started in February 2019, gives 125 residents $500 a month for 24 months. I trusted that recipients would spend the cash as they needed for themselves and their families, and that’s exactly what the data have shown—40% of all spending has been on food, 25% on sales and merchandise, 11% on utilities and less than 2% on tobacco and alcohol. And less than 2% of recipients are unemployed and not looking for work, thus helping to dismantle the malicious and racist tropes that those struggling with economic insecurity will squander money or stop working.</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p >Building on the success of my pilot, in June 2020 I launched Mayors for a Guaranteed Income, a coalition of more than 25 mayors advocating a federal guaranteed income. Mayors have been on the political front lines of not only covid-19, but also the civil unrest that followed the killings of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and others. Although these protests began in response to police brutality, they are also about the violence of poverty and economic insecurity and continue a conversation we’ve been having for 400 years: does the inalienable right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness truly apply to everyone?</p><p >Poverty and economic insecurity are choices of policy, not of individuals. Covid-19 and the global Black Lives Matter protests point to the simple and undeniable truth that we must chart a new path forward—a path that sees and acknowledges the dignity of all of humanity. The coming year beckons for a New Deal that puts poverty and scarcity in a museum and unleashes the degree of well-being and sense of belonging needed to create the beloved community in which we all deserve to live.<span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p><p ><em>This article appeared in the United States section of the print edition of The World in 2021 under the headline “An idea whose time has come”</em></p>
