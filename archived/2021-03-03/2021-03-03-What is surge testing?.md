One tool is surge testing, which the British government has ordered to occur all over England. What is it and how can it help control the spread of the virus?</p><p >Confusingly, surge testing can refer to two different types of test. One looks for variant strains of the virus, like the one from South Africa, to work out whether they are proliferating. The main goal of this sort of testing is to help researchers spot strains that are becoming a serious threat, so as to study their behaviour and identify strategies that can thwart them—including <a href="https://www.economist.com/briefing/2021/02/13/when-covid-19-vaccines-meet-the-new-variants-of-the-virus">tweaking vaccines</a>. In the short run, testing for variants does not do much to get the virus under control but it can help fight it later on. This testing is taking place widely across Britain right now and other countries are rapidly building their capacity to undertake it. </p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p >The other type of testing is aimed at identifying asymptomatic people who are infected with any strain of the virus and urging them to go into self isolation. The logic is that putting symptom-free spreaders into isolation breaks the chain of transmission and cuts the number of infections in the community. </p><p >This kind of surge testing is expensive and exceptionally hard to use successfully. To have a meaningful impact on society it must be done on everyone in a community. This calls for vast numbers of testing kits and often relies on untrained people collecting the samples, which inevitably affects reliability. There must also be the right mix of social support, enforcement and incentives for people to take the tests in the first place.</p><p >In <a href="https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2020/11/14/fast-tests-for-covid-19-are-coming">Slovakia</a> (pictured), this type of testing was conducted over two days at the end of October on 3.6m of the 5.5m people in the country. People who tested negative received a certificate that they had to keep with them and present on request. Those who opted to not be tested had to stay at home or face penalties for being in public without a certificate. For those who tested positive and could not easily isolate at home owing to crowded conditions, accommodation was provided by the state. Similarly, those who had to be off work without pay after testing positive received compensation. Crucially, infected individuals were extensively interviewed by a track-and-trace team who asked them who they had been with, identified others who were likely to be infected and then told them to go into isolation. </p><p >All of this hard work slowed the spread of the virus for a time, but by mid-December Slovakia was reporting more cases a week than it had been before testing began. By contrast, testing of the same sort in November in <a href="https://www.economist.com/britain/2020/11/21/liverpools-mass-testing-shows-promise-but-must-reach-more-people">Liverpool</a>, in north-west England, was voluntary, offered those who tested positive precious little support and had no significant mechanisms of enforcement. It was doomed to fail.</p><p >For surge testing of any sort to work, attendance must be mandatory and almost the entire population must participate. If governments find that notion unpalatable they should invest in other ways of controlling the virus, like a robust track, trace and quarantine-enforcement service.</p><p ><strong>Dig deeper</strong></p><p ><em>All our stories relating to the pandemic and the vaccines can be found on our <a href="https://www.economist.com/news/2020/03/11/the-economists-coverage-of-the-coronavirus">coronavirus hub</a>.
