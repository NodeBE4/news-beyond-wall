But the honour might easily belong to Turkey’s central bank. In under two years, three of its governors have been booted out of office by the country’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan. The latest, Naci Agbal, came flying out in the wee hours of March 20th, after barely four months in the job. (The same night, for good measure, Mr Erdogan withdrew Turkey from an international convention protecting women from violence.) The Turkish lira plunged by as much as 15% against the dollar in early trading on March 22nd, before recovering some of its losses. Analysts sounded alarm bells, warning of a fresh currency crisis. Istanbul’s main stock-exchange index fell by more than 9%.</p><p >Mr Agbal’s removal may be the most dramatic to date. With a series of long overdue interest-rate increases, including one of two percentage points on March 18th, the governor had offered investors a <a href="https://www.economist.com/europe/2021/03/20/naci-agbal-tries-to-restore-monetary-discipline-in-turkey">glimmer of hope</a> that the central bank was something other than an extension of Mr Erdogan’s government. That hope is now gone. A reversal of Mr Agbal’s policies seems imminent. The lira, which had surged back to life after losing half of its dollar value in under four years, is back on the ropes. Mr Agbal’s willingness to take tough measures to rein in inflation and an unsustainable credit boom had raised hopes. With a single stroke of his pen, Mr Erdogan sent them, and Turkey’s currency, crashing back down. “This decision is almost as bad as Brexit,” wrote Timothy Ash of BlueBay Asset Management, “in terms of being the worst public-policy decision I can remember in a country’s history.”</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p >The new head of the bank, Sahap Kavcioglu, a former ruling-party parliamentarian, sought to pre-empt the damage over the weekend, saying he would continue efforts to tackle inflation, which reached the alarming height of 15.6% last month. Investors were unimpressed. It does not help that Mr Kavcioglu has previously opined that the key to fighting inflation was lowering rates, a view ridiculed by leading economists but long embraced by Mr Erdogan. “While interest rates in the world are close to zero, an increase in interest rates will not solve the economic problems in our country,” Mr Kavcioglu wrote in a newspaper column last month. “Because interest-rate increases will indirectly lead to an increase in inflation.”</p><p >Unable to keep up with Mr Erdogan’s antics, analysts seem to have given up trying to predict what might happen next. The brutal market reaction may give Mr Erdogan some pause for thought. “My guess is that it’s going to get through to Erdogan that a country with so much foreign debt does not have the freedom to set interest rates as low as it likes,” says Paul McNamara, investment director at GAM, an asset-management firm. Turkey’s president and the central bank may grudgingly surrender to the markets, he says. “There needs to be a realisation they’ve bitten off more than they can chew.” Turkey&#x27;s short-term foreign debt, falling due in the next 12 months, reached $140bn in January.</p><p >That realisation may take some time to sink in. Turkey may resort to stopgap measures, spending billions of dollars through state banks in defence of the lira to pave the way for a rate cut next month. This will be a losing battle, says Phoenix Kalen of Société Générale. With the central bank’s foreign-currency reserves already depleted after a series of interventions last year, the bank has run out of ammunition. “They will not be able to hold the line,” says Ms Kalen. “I think we’re headed toward another currency crisis.” Net reserves stand at $10.9bn, about one-fifth of GDP, down from $30.7bn a year ago.</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p >A related but more distant risk is that the government might resort to capital controls. Turkey’s finance minister ruled those out on March 22nd. Some analysts, however, have not. “If there’s a rate cut, I don’t know how they can control the exchange rate in the absence of controls,” says Selva Demiralp, an economist at Koc University in Istanbul. “The pressure on the lira would be unbearable.”</p><p >In a country such as Turkey, which relies heavily on capital inflows, such controls would bring the economy to a halt. They would also be deeply unpopular with ordinary Turks and the businessmen who support Mr Erdogan. That makes them unlikely, but no longer unthinkable. “Even the fear of capital controls would be very counterproductive,” says Emre Akcakmak, a portfolio adviser at East Capital in Dubai. “But nobody expected a central bank head who had been doing a decent job to be fired overnight,” he says. “That’s telling you to expect the unexpected.”</p>
