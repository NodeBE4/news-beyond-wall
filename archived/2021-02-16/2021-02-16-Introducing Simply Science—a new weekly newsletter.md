The few astronomers who did work in the field, such as Carl Sagan, a celebrated American astronomer who died in 1996, could only do so because they had already built up their reputations in what were considered more serious areas of science. Still, they had to brave what Sagan called the “giggle factor”—ridicule by their peers. NASA, America’s space agency, largely kept the research at arm’s length. It may have been that they were worried about accusations of wasting time and money looking for “little green men”.</blockquote><p >“Simply Science” is one of a number of newsletters produced by <i>The Economist</i>, including “<a href="https://www.economist.com/theclimateissue">The Climate Issue</a>”, which focuses on environmental matters; “<a href="https://www.economist.com/checksandbalance">Checks and Balance</a>”, our weekly analysis of US politics; and “<a href="https://www.economist.com/offthecharts">Off the Charts</a>”, a deep dive into our data journalism.
