Lava Jato (Car Wash) started in 2014 as an unremarkable money-laundering probe before growing into a much wider inquiry into malfeasance. But in early 2021 the task force of prosecutors who had led the probe in Curitiba, in southern Brazil, <a href="https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2021/02/27/the-sad-quiet-death-of-brazils-anti-corruption-task-force">was wound up</a>. The public was too distracted by the covid-19 pandemic and the terrible state of the economy to take much notice. The inquiry has led to the conviction of 174 people, including a few of Brazil’s most senior politicians, and recovered at least 26bn reais ($5bn) for the public coffers. But on March 8th Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, a popular former president and the investigation’s prize catch, had two convictions for corruption annulled by Edson Fachin, a Supreme Court justice. Did Lava Jato achieve lasting change?</p><p >Lava Jato’s name belies its seriousness. The original probe focused on a petrol station in Brasília, the capital, which was used by money-launderers. Ironically, it did not have a car wash. One black-market money-dealer was found to have links with Paulo Roberto Costa, a former director of Petrobras, the state-controlled oil company. It emerged that Petrobras had been awarding over-generous state contracts to construction companies, which then ensured that Brazil’s politicians and their parties got their cut. The inquiry expanded as investigators uncovered a mass of related offences, and hundreds of arrests followed. Prosecutors, overseen by a young judge, Sérgio Moro, made heavy use of pre-trial detention to extract plea bargains, then a new weapon in the judiciary’s arsenal. </p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p >The revelations of Lava Jato brought Brazilians onto the streets in protest and made them believe that the country’s rampant corruption could be overcome. Politicians of all stripes were caught up, among them two of the three immediate predecessors of the current president, Jair Bolsonaro. Lula served 18 months of a 12-year term for corruption and money-laundering before being released. Michel Temer is accused of embezzling 1.8bn reais, and remains under investigation. Though Dilma Rousseff, whose presidential term separated those of Lula and Mr Temer, was not directly implicated in the scandal, Lava Jato played a role in her impeachment. She had chaired the board of Petrobras when many of the bribes happened and became deeply unpopular. The charges Ms Rousseff faced related to her manipulation of the federal budget to disguise Brazil’s economic problems, but it is widely thought that Eduardo Cunha, the speaker of the lower house at the time, initiated impeachment proceedings because Ms Rousseff refused to protect him from the investigation. Mr Cunha was convicted of corruption, tax evasion and money-laundering and is currently under house arrest, having left prison only because of the pandemic.</p><p >Lula’s legal troubles were enough to keep him out of the 2018 election, won by Mr Bolsonaro. The new president made Mr Moro justice minister, but Mr Moro’s reputation for impartiality was soon further tarnished. In June 2019 a <a href="https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2019/06/15/brazils-lava-jato-corruption-investigation-could-self-destruct">trove of hacked messages</a> revealed that he had collaborated with prosecutors, offering advice and investigative leads. Suspicions arose that Mr Moro was motivated less by a concern for justice than political animus. Mr Fachin quashed Lula’s convictions on the grounds that Mr Moro’s court in Curitiba lacked jurisdiction. Although the case is likely to be sent to another court, and Lula faces other charges, as of now he is free to run for president again in 2022.</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p >Mr Moro’s fall from grace fuelled a backlash among the political and judicial classes. The Supreme Court and other tribunals, which at first supported the investigation, started ruling against it and in favour of politicians as the investigation’s net expanded. Mr Bolsonaro lost whatever interest in tackling graft he might have once had when his own family was caught up in a separate corruption investigation. By October 2020, Mr Bolsonaro declared that Lava Jato would wrap up, since there was “no more corruption in the government”. Mr Moro resigned as justice minister in April 2020, claiming that Mr Bolsonaro sacked the chief of the federal police to protect his sons, Flávio and Carlos, both of whom are under investigation. In February 2021, the task force of prosecutors in Curitiba was disbanded. Any success that the investigations, arrests and convictions had in cleaning up Brazilian politics will probably be ephemeral. Lava Jato removed some bad actors from the stage, but failed to fix the culture of corruption. </p><p >Lava Jato did pioneer new techniques and a new boldness in tackling corruption and the traditional impunity enjoyed by the powerful in Latin America. Its demise will be a blow to anti-corruption drives elsewhere in the region. Many of these investigations are still in their early stages and, like Lava Jato, subject to concerns about political control. But the lasting lesson from Lava Jato is the vital importance of insulating the judiciary from politicisation. </p><br><hr><div>获取更多RSS：<br><a href="https://feedx.net" style="color:orange" target="_blank">https://feedx.net</a> <br><a href="https://feedx.top" style="color:orange" target="_blank">https://feedx.top</a><br></div>
