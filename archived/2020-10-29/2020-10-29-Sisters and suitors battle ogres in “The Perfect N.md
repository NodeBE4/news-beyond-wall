It tells of the very first Kikuyu and their passionate attachment to Mount Kenya, the home of their god, Ngai.</p><p >Early in their marriage, fleeing war and starvation, Gikuyu and Mumbi, his “partner in everything”, settle in the mountain’s foothills. They bring up a family of famously beautiful, self-reliant girls; the youngest, Warigia, is an ace with the bow and arrow, although disabled from birth and unable to walk. When 99 suitors turn up one day in search of brides, Gikuyu and Mumbi urge their daughters to test the men first and then choose, but above all to choose wisely.</p><blockquote><p>“Warigia is my last born,” Mumbi explained.<br/>“She makes up the Perfect Nine.<br/>Her eyes can see a long way, and her ears hear sounds from afar.<br/>Her legs are the only organs that remained those of a child.<br/>The rest of the body is a grown woman, and she does things her own way.”</p></blockquote><p >Mr wa Thiong’o’s writing is rich with Kikuyu folklore and observations about this mountain of tropical forests and icy peaks, and his verse has a galloping intensity that gives the narrative momentum. The men are instructed that they must first build new homes, each named after one of the daughters. Then the suitors must bring back the cure for Warigia’s disability, which, they are told, is a single hair that can be found only on the tongue of an ogre.</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p >The sisters take the men up the mountain, trying their courage and devotion. Some get eaten by crocodiles, others sink in the mud or are bitten by snakes. Many run away. And then on the upper slopes they encounter the ogres, among them the Ogre of Endless Tears and the Ogre that Shat Without Stopping, around whom the air “smelled of pure rot”. The posse:</p><blockquote><p>feared that the rot might pollute the rivers.<br/>Polluting air and water is poisoning life.<br/>We chased the ogre with the sweet smell of fresh flowers.</p></blockquote><p >Gifted, ingenious and brave, the older sisters have a generosity of spirit that is well conveyed in the book’s lolloping rhythms. But it is Warigia’s story—with its challenges, uncertainties and bittersweet ending—that gives this tale its deep humanity. Most writers lose their energy and inventiveness as they grow old. Not Mr wa Thiong’o. “The Perfect Nine” is one of the year’s great discoveries. <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p><p data-test-id="Footnote" >This article appeared in the Books &amp; arts section of the print edition under the headline &quot;Magic mountain&quot;</p>
