Samuel Taylor Coleridge and Robert Southey envisaged creating a society governed along the latest Pantisocratic principles, with no private property and plenty of time for art. They would write sonnets while ploughing the soil, criticise poetry while chasing buffalo and discuss metaphysics while chopping down trees. It came to nothing, for the usual reasons: lack of money and disagreement about who would ultimately be in charge. Southey, for example, thought that women should do all the domestic work and the child care. Coleridge disagreed.</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p >As well as writing Romantic verse, both Coleridge and Southey would go on to be prominent conservatives. Coleridge became preoccupied with the need to maintain order. He also worried that democracy would ruin valuable elitist pursuits, such as the composition of lengthy poems about decrepit sailors. Southey went further. Though he became poet laureate, he thought that people who committed libel ought to be transported to Australia. When a cavalry regiment fatally charged into a crowd of protesters in Manchester in 1819, Southey blamed the crowd.</p><p >The crossing of boundaries that separate it from radicalism is a theme of Edmund Fawcett’s epic history of conservatism. It begins, as is traditional, with the French revolution. Previous revolutions—1688 in England, 1776 in America—could be seen as defences of ancient liberties, and so as attempts to restore something that had been spoiled by despotism. But 1789 was different; there was nothing ancient or restorative about the guillotine and the basket. In arguments against the French revolution, a conservative tradition was founded. It has been an essential ingredient of Western democracy ever since.</p><p >Throughout its first 200 years, conservatism has contained an unresolvable tension. Robert Peel, the Tory prime minister who created London’s Metropolitan Police, thought his party’s governing philosophy ought to be to oppose unneeded social change wherever possible, but to accept it where necessary. Writing much later, Samuel Huntington, an American academic, thought that in this regard all conservatism was “situational”. But how to tell the difference between unnecessary change and the unavoidable sort?</p><h2>Bend or break</h2><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p >Subordinate to that big question are several other conservative puzzles. Is democracy good, because it is generally a source of order, or bad, because it can pose a threat to established ways of doing things? Is capitalism too disruptive a force for conservatives to embrace? Are the masses possessed of plain common sense, or should complex matters of state be left to an enlightened (conservative) elite? Is modern architecture mostly harmless, or should it all be bulldozed and replaced by something with a nice portico?</p><p >Previously the author of a penetrating history of liberalism, Mr Fawcett—who also wrote for <em>The Economist</em> for 30 years, from London, Paris, Berlin and Washington, until he retired in 2003—traces these tensions through a multistorey pantheon of thinkers in Britain, France, Germany and America. Almost all are men; each is put briefly into historical context, with sketches of the politics of their time. The result is more guidebook than essay, but to the extent that Mr Fawcett has a unifying thesis it is that liberal democracies flourish when conservatives feel safe in them, and are prone to collapse when they do not. Or, to put the proposition in reverse: compromising conservatism is a vital part of a healthy democracy; the uncompromising kind is a threat to liberty.</p><p >Practical, compromising conservatism of the sort pursued in the past by prime ministers and presidents has sought to embrace its contradictions rather than take sides. By doing so it became the dominant force in Western governance. Despite initially setting themselves up as an opposition force in the countries covered here, conservatives have exercised more power than liberals or socialists combined. They also have a decent record in the kind of social reforms that liberals like to think are their turf. The extension of the franchise in Britain is a good example of compromising conservatism: British Tories spent much of the 19th century arguing for restrictions on the right to vote, before doubling the size of the electorate in 1867—and proceeding to win six of the next ten general elections under the new rules.</p><p >Uncompromising conservatism has a darker history. In Mr Fawcett’s telling it runs from Joseph de Maistre and his counter-revolutionaries in the French-speaking world; to the pro-slavery arguments made by John C. Calhoun in America’s Senate; and on to the 20th-century conservatives in France and Germany who failed to defend democracy, a failure which allowed jackbooted fascists to march through Europe in the 1930s. Chastened by that experience, and aided by the foreclosing of radical options that had tempted some of its adherents before the second world war, conservatism then enjoyed its greatest period—from 1945 until very recently.</p><p >Now conservatism is in trouble again. Most of its front-rank thinkers in America feel orphaned by a movement they helped create, as conservatism as a political brand has been seized by people like Viktor Orban, Marine Le Pen and Donald Trump. Defeat for Mr Trump, though, would offer another chance for this flexible ideology’s renewal. The way out, so the past couple of centuries suggest, is to think hard about what is worth hanging on to and what must be abandoned. And then to compromise. <span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p><p ><em><strong>John Prideaux:</strong> We identify the reviewers of books connected to The Economist or its staff.
