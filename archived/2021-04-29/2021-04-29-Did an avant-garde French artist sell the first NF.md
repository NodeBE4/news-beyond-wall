The sum was particularly striking because the artwork in question won’t hang in the buyer’s super-yacht, or even his hallway. It exists only online: anyone with an internet connection can see it, whenever and wherever they want. They can even copy it and share it with others. Free. So what was actually sold?</p><p >“Everydays: the First 5000 Days” was made by Mike Winkelmann, an American graphic artist who goes by the name of Beeple. It is a digital collage of 5,000 images Beeple has designed over the years, which together form a dizzying spectacle. Anyone can find this image on the internet, so the buyer of this item was not acquiring the artwork itself, but a receipt showing that he is the owner of the original digital file. These digital receipts, known as “non-fungible tokens” (<small>NFT</small>s), have now become the talk of the art world. Since the transaction occurred at Christie’s, a leading auction house, it carried special weight.</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p >If this sounds absurd to you, you’re not alone. David Hockney, who painted the second-most-expensive artwork by a living artist ever sold at auction, expressed bemusement: “What is it they’re owning? I don’t really know.” Some in the art world sneered at Beeple. One critic described “Everydays” in the <em>New York Times</em> as “indiscriminately collated pictures of cartoon monsters, gross-out gags and a breastfeeding Donald Trump”. Many were simply confused about why anyone would pay so much to buy something that can never truly be theirs.</p><p data-caps="initial" ><span data-caps="initial">T</span>he art world has a history of subverting our understanding of art and beauty. When the Impressionists held their first exhibition in 1874, critics despaired at the paintings by Monet, Degas and others as ugly and formless.</p><blockquote><p>Yves Klein convinced an American couple to hand over 14 gold ingots worth around $2,000 today in exchange for nothing but fresh air</p></blockquote><p >Beeple is not the first person to stretch the idea of what can be sold as art. In 1962 Yves Klein, a French avant-garde artist and former coach of the Spanish judo team, persuaded an American couple to hand over 14 gold ingots worth around $2,000 today in exchange for nothing but fresh air. The buyers, a screenwriter called Michael Blankfort and his wife, received a receipt confirming that they had bought a “Zone of Immaterial Pictorial Sensibility”. Klein then asked the Blankforts to burn the receipt, threw half the gold into the Seine and melted the rest to use in other works. An art dealer and a museum curator looked on, conferring a measure of artistic legitimacy on the proceedings.</p><figure data-image-nozoom="true"><div itemscope="" itemProp="image" itemType="https://schema.org/ImageObject"><meta itemProp="url" content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1080/1547/90/1843magazine.com/sites/default/files/1843_20210428_NFTYVESKLEIN_002.jpg"/><img loading="lazy" width="1080" height="1547" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1080/1547/90/1843magazine.com/sites/default/files/1843_20210428_NFTYVESKLEIN_002.jpg"  sizes="(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw" alt=""/></div><figcaption><strong>Trickster or genius? </strong>Yves Klein, a French avant-garde artist, pictured in 1961 ( opening image ).

In 1958 he emptied a Parisian gallery, white-washed the walls and invited people in to see his “immaterial” artwork. Guests at the exhibition, which was entitled “The Void”, were served a cocktail that turned their urine blue for a week. On opening night Klein reportedly sold two non-existent works of art.</p><p >Klein claimed that he wanted to challenge the idea of what art could be, by breaking the distinction between an artistic object and the world around it. The Blankforts did not buy an item that could be transported and sold on, but an experience. No physical artefact needed to exist for the “Zones” to be considered an artwork, Klein thought.</p><p >Some European intellectuals praised his ingenuity, but America had little time for such high-minded wackiness: <em>Time</em> magazine called him “a fad” when he visited New York in 1961. The city’s art crowd mostly steered clear of Klein’s shows.</p><figure data-image-nozoom="true"><div itemscope="" itemProp="image" itemType="https://schema.org/ImageObject"><meta itemProp="url" content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1080/1145/90/1843magazine.com/sites/default/files/1843_20210428_NFTYVESKLEIN_003.jpg"/><img loading="lazy" width="1080" height="1145" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1080/1145/90/1843magazine.com/sites/default/files/1843_20210428_NFTYVESKLEIN_003.jpg"  sizes="(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw" alt=""/></div><figcaption><strong>The pursuit of nothingness </strong> One of the artworks at “The Void”, Klein’s exhibition of immaterial art, held in Paris in 1958 ( above )</figcaption></figure><p >The Blankforts’ receipt, like the <small>NFT</small> issued for Beeple’s work, proved ownership of something that no one can exclusively possess. In Klein’s case this applied to fresh air; in Beeple’s it is a <small>JPEG</small> file that anyone with an internet connection can download.</p><p >So why buy it? The owner might claim that the $69m version of Beeple’s artwork has an authenticity that copies of the file do not. Buyers get bragging rights but also, some people have argued, a unique encounter that viewers of a mere copy do not. After buying Parisian air from Klein, Michael Blankfort wrote that there was “no other experience in art equal to the depth of feeling” caused by buying his “Zone”, and that he felt “an explosion of awareness of time and space”.</p><p >Yet there is an important difference between Klein and Beeple. Klein made his buyers burn their receipt. He wanted them to relinquish evidence of their claim to the work and prevent the receipt from itself becoming an art object, accruing value through its association with him. He threw away gold, which had been the ultimate store of value for millennia, showing that his art was not a financial asset to be sold for profit.</p><figure data-image-nozoom="true"><div itemscope="" itemProp="image" itemType="https://schema.org/ImageObject"><meta itemProp="url" content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/1280/90/1843magazine.com/sites/default/files/1843_20210428_NFTBEEPLE_004.jpg"/><img loading="lazy" width="1280" height="1280" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/1280/90/1843magazine.com/sites/default/files/1843_20210428_NFTBEEPLE_004.jpg"  sizes="(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw" alt=""/></div></figure><figure data-image-nozoom="true"><div itemscope="" itemProp="image" itemType="https://schema.org/ImageObject"><meta itemProp="url" content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/1601/90/1843magazine.com/sites/default/files/1843_20210428_NFTBEEPLE_005.jpg"/><img loading="lazy" width="1280" height="1601" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/1280/1601/90/1843magazine.com/sites/default/files/1843_20210428_NFTBEEPLE_005.jpg"  sizes="(min-width: 720px) 640px, 95vw" alt=""/></div><figcaption><strong>Eye-watering </strong> “Everydays: the First 5000 Days”, Beeple’s digital collage sold for $69.3m ( top ). One of the 5,000 works that formed “Everydays” ( above )</figcaption></figure><p >Beeple has given his buyers no such encouragement to destroy the digital receipts. <small>NFT</small>s are stored on a blockchain, a digital database that publicly records online transactions, providing proof of ownership. A blockchain is impossible to tamper with because it is not controlled by a single entity, as a bank’s ledger is. This means that an <small>NFT</small> can never be deleted, but it can be transferred to another owner, as is already happening with other <small>NFT</small>s.</p><p >The buyer of “Everydays” seemed more interested in the work&#x27;s financial potential than its artistic value. Vignesh Sundaresan, the cryptocurrency investor based in Singapore known as MetaKovan who bought “Everydays”, boasted that it is “going to be a billion-dollar piece someday”. He made little mention of its aesthetic qualities in interviews. MetaKovan runs an investment fund that has already bought up other <small>NFT</small>s, including many issued by Beeple. The high price MetaKovan paid for “Everydays” also pushed up the price of other Beeple <small>NFT</small>s. That made MetaKovan’s fund even more valuable. It just so happens that Beeple himself was given around 2% of that fund by MetaKovan.</p><blockquote><p>Klein fleeced the art world in order to critique it, Beeple seems keen to cash in</p></blockquote><p >MetaKovan is perhaps right not to lay stress on the power of the artwork itself. You can buy <small>NFT</small>s linked to any digital item, from a video clip to a music file. In March 2021 Jack Dorsey, co-founder of Twitter, sold an <small>NFT</small> linked to the first-ever tweet, which he sent in 2006, for almost $3m (he gave the money to charity). But the emphasis on commerce over content indicates an important difference between past and present.</p><p >Klein was often ridiculed during his lifetime. These days he is regarded as an influential avant-garde artist. In 2002 a receipt book for “Zones of Immaterial Pictorial Sensibility” sold at auction for £14,300; in 2015 a monochrome blue rectangle that Klein painted fetched £6.1m. Klein’s efforts to prevent his works being treated as commodities actually made them more valuable.</p><p >Beeple, by contrast, has embraced the commercial potential of his art. He was paid for “Everydays” in Ether, a volatile cryptocurrency, though quickly converted it into dollars after the sale. Klein fleeced the art world in order to critique it, Beeple seems keen to cash in.<span data-ornament="ufinish">■</span></p><p ><strong>Bo Franklin</strong> is <em>The Economist</em>’s Explainers editor</p><p ><small>IMAGES: ©SUCCESSION YVES KLEIN C/O ADAGP, PARIS AND DACS, LONDON 2021.
