No coal was burned to generate any portion of it for a period of more than two months, something that had not happened since the Industrial Revolution. Britain’s four remaining coal-burning power plants are zombies, all but dead. Within a couple of years they will be closed and Britain will probably never burn coal for electricity again.</p><div ><figure><div itemscope="" itemProp="image" itemType="https://schema.org/ImageObject" data-slim="1"><meta itemProp="url" content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/772/90/sites/default/files/20210220_WOC732.png"/><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/772/90/sites/default/files/20210220_WOC732.png"  sizes="300px" alt=""/></div></figure><p >The elimination of power stations that burn coal has helped Britain cut its carbon emissions faster than any other rich country since 1990. They are down by 44%, according to data collected by the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) during a period when the economy grew by two-thirds. Germany’s emissions, in contrast, are down by 29%; coal is still burned to generate some 24% of its electricity. Britain has made cuts to its emissions 1.8 times larger than the EU average since 1990. The emissions of other rich countries like America, Japan and Australia are flat over the same period, or even up slightly.</p><p >Britain’s success has given it prominence in the global debate on climate change. This year it will host COP26 in Glasgow, the world’s largest and most important climate gathering. Boris Johnson, the prime minister, is attracted to the futuristic whizbangery of clean energy and is deploying “climate diplomacy” to help define post-Brexit Britain’s place in the world. In November he presented a “ten point plan for a green industrial revolution” that included spending £12bn on clean energy gubbins. But examining Britain’s decarbonisation shows that much of its success was circumstantial, and that the country’s hardest problems are ahead of it. After a decade of meeting its own legally-binding decarbonisation targets, Britain is now veering off course.</p><p >Unusually for a right-wing politician, Margaret Thatcher was an early believer in the dangers of global warming. But the impetus she gave to decarbonisation was a by-product of policies with other aims. In crushing the coal miners’ unions in the 80s, she neutered a powerful industry that was dedicated to the emission of carbon. Privatising Britain’s energy markets and opening up the North Sea for oil and gas exploitation weakened the coal industry further. Britain’s emissions declined gently after Mrs Thatcher left office, long before climate change was on the national agenda, simply because a growing proportion of Britain’s electricity and heat was being generated by burning gas, which emits about half as much carbon dioxide as coal when burned.</p><p >But this century, decarbonisation has been the deliberate consequence of political choices. In passing the Climate Change Act in 2008, Britain became the first country in the world to commit itself to legally binding carbon-emission reduction. Labour was in power at the time, but there was a remarkable political consensus in its favour. Only three MPs voted against it. According to Phil MacDonald of Ember, a think-tank, David Cameron’s Conservative Party was casting around for policies that might detoxify its image, and found its issue with climate change. “Cameron bought into [the act] very early,” says Mr MacDonald.</p></div><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-1"></div></div></div><p >The weak, dirty coal industry was an obvious target for a country newly-united against the emission of carbon. In 2013, a Conservative-Lib Dem coalition government introduced a power-sector carbon tax called the Carbon Price Support. The tax hit coal twice as hard as gas, instantly making it uncompetitive. Coal plants which had been running continuously started being switched off, coming back on only when electricity was in high demand. In 2015 coal produced about a quarter of Britain’s electricity. Now it accounts for less than 2%.</p><div ><figure><div itemscope="" itemProp="image" itemType="https://schema.org/ImageObject" data-slim="1"><meta itemProp="url" content="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/1546/90/sites/default/files/20210220_WOC733.png"/><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.economist.com/img/b/608/1546/90/sites/default/files/20210220_WOC733.png"  sizes="300px" alt=""/></div></figure><p >As the cost of wind farms plummeted, gas started feeling the squeeze too. In its latest carbon budget, the Climate Change Committee (CCC), the independent body created by the Climate Change Act to steer Britain towards net zero through a series of policy recommendations, said that Britain should commit to phasing out gas power plants by 2035. This has changed the economics of new gas power stations. Drax, a power company which had been planning to build Europe’s largest gas power station in Yorkshire, is now reconsidering. “The risk for investors in those utilities is that they are only going to get a decade out of it,” says Mr MacDonald.</p><p >The grid is not yet completely decarbonised, but that seems bound to happen as the price of electricity from renewable sources continues to fall. “The economics have just shifted so that wind is the default,” says Mr MacDonald. Solar power has grown too, but a cloudy, crowded island is ill-suited to the technology. In 2020 solar provided just 4% of electricity. Wind provided almost a quarter.</p><p >Consumers have barely felt the costs of the transformation to date. Paying for low-carbon electricity accounted for about 9% of bills in 2016, but increases in the efficiency of light bulbs and appliances offset the rise in power costs. The CCC estimates that required efficiency increases will more than cover the increased cost of electricity in future.</p><p ><strong>No guarantee of future results </strong><br/>Zero-carbon electricity is an end in itself, but also a necessary first step to decarbonising other parts of the economy, such as heating and transport. Heat pumps must replace gas boilers; electric motors must replace internal combustion engines. But Britain’s success in decarbonising its grid has not yet translated into progress in these other areas. Where emissions related to electricity generation plunged by 66% between 1990 and 2019, the equivalent reduction for transport, which is now the largest source of emissions in Britain, is just 5%. Buildings generate the second-largest block of emissions, largely thanks to the energy required to heat them, which tends to be produced by burning gas to heat water in radiators.</p></div><p >It is harder to decarbonise heat and transport than electricity. The only change that consumers notice when dirty power sources are replaced with clean ones is a slow increase in price. But in order for heating and transport to be decarbonised, either policy or market mechanisms must reach right into people&#x27;s homes and parking lots. Incentivising them to rip out their combi boilers and switch to electric cars will be expensive at best, impossible at worst.</p><p >Heat is a particularly tricky issue in Britain, for its people are fond of old, higgledy-piggledy houses, which are pretty but badly insulated. Keeping them warm is easier with gas, which has a high energy density, than with electricity, which tends to generate lower temperatures. As well as installing heat pumps, Brits will also need bigger radiators or underfloor heating. That will cost tens of thousands of pounds per home. Transport poses a similar problem; Britain’s cities are old, their streets small and winding. Finding the space to install the required charging points for electric cars will be tricky. Mr Johnson’s commitment, as part of his ten-point plan, to end sales of petrol and diesel cars in Britain by 2030, will help a lot.</p><div id="" ><div><div id="econ-2"></div></div></div><p >And where gas helped decarbonise Britain&#x27;s grid, it is a hindrance when it comes to heating and transport. That is because Britain has one of the world’s most robust and extensive infrastructures for moving gas around; 85% of its 29m homes are heated with gas boilers. In Germany 47% are. Decades of investment in the gas grid means that Britain’s electricity grid is not as robust as it needs to be in order to carry the extra power required to replace gas in the heating of Britain’s homes. In order to charge all the cars and run all the heat pumps, the grid will need to be upgraded at a cost of tens of billions of pounds.</p><p >The political unity that drove out coal shows signs of fraying too. In 2015 the Conservative government scrapped a plan to make all new homes carbon-neutral, meaning that most houses built since then have gas boilers and low-quality insulation, so will need retrofitting. Fuel duty, which would incentivise car electrification, has been frozen since 2010. Chancellor Rishi Sunak plans to raise it in his forthcoming budget, but faces opposition from his party. And in early February, 24 hours after the right-wing <em>Daily Mail</em> called a proposed carbon tax that would have raised the price of consumer goods a “tax raid on your lifestyle!”, the government dropped it like a hot potato.</p><p >The challenges of heat and transport are already showing up on Britain’s carbon budget. The country is no longer on track to meet its own legally mandated targets for reducing emissions. In 2017, BEIS projected that Britain was set to miss its 2030 target by 8%. One year later in 2018 that gap rose to 10%. The problems posed by transport and heating are largely responsible.</p><p >Mr Johnson’s ten-point plan therefore reads more as an ode to successes past than a sensible recipe for the future. But Britain’s moment on the world stage of climate policy approaches, so its recent performance and future plans will be in the spotlight. The prime minister cannot rest on his predecessors’ laurels.</p>
